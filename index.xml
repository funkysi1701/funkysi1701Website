This starting me thinking about what would be involved in upgrading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upgrading production environments is complex and there are licensing considerations to take into account. However for non production workloads like development this isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem so lets look at that first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past I have installed SQL Server Devloper Edition onto my laptop, this is fine but I have found that unless you are very careful you may end up with multiple different versions of SQL Server sitting around, and it is difficult to cleanly remove them without a fresh install of the OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However in this day and age, Docker and Containers are king. My current development environment makes use of Docker and has a docker compose file which sets up SQL Server for this particular application, lets take a look.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">sqlserver&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">image&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">container_name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">Sql&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">ports&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;5432:1433&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">networks&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">my-network&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">volumes&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This defines which docker image to use, in this case 2019-latest, sets up ports and the name and saves the data on a docker volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we then run SELECT @@VERSION on this instance of SQL Server we get told:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM-CU13) (KB5005679) - 15.0.4178.1 (X64) Sep 23 2021 16:47:49 Copyright (C) 2019 Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS) &amp;lt;X64&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>What if we change the docker-compose file to use 2022-latest?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>manifest for mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest tagged by &amp;quot;2022-latest&amp;quot; is not found
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>SQL Server 2022 hasn&amp;rsquo;t been released yet so there is no docker image for it yet. Try this command again in a few months when it is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK so what else can we try? What about a downgrade to 2017-latest? Will that work?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Server 2017 starts but the following error gets logged.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>2022-02-23 21:41:15.30 Server Software Usage Metrics is disabled.
2022-02-23 21:41:15.30 spid6s Starting up database 'master'.
2022-02-23 21:41:15.34 spid6s Error: 948, Severity: 20, State: 1.
2022-02-23 21:41:15.34 spid6s The database 'master' cannot be opened because it is version 904. This server supports version 869 and earlier. A downgrade path is not supported.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Doh we can&amp;rsquo;t downgrade the existing database we have. Probably a good thing really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft release regular updates for SQL Server called CU&amp;rsquo;s (Cumulative Updates), you can see above we are on CU13. Is there a CU14 or CU15 we could try?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update the docker compose to: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-CU14-ubuntu-20.04&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point I actually got an error&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>2022-02-23 21:50:20.71 Server Error: 17058, Severity: 16, State: 1.
2022-02-23 21:50:20.71 Server initerrlog: Could not open error log file '/var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog'. Operating system error = 5(Access is denied.).
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This is caused by trying to use SQL Server 2017 but it is easy to fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In docker desktop there is a volumes section, find the volume you are using with SQL Server and delete the errorlog mentioned above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Docker Desktop" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2022/docker-desktop1.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you retry SQL will start OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Repeating the SELECT @@VERSION gives us a new CU&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM-CU14) (KB5007182) - 15.0.4188.2 (X64) Nov 3 2021 19:19:51 Copyright (C) 2019 Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS) &amp;lt;X64&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM-CU15) (KB5008996) - 15.0.4198.2 (X64) Jan 12 2022 22:30:08 Copyright (C) 2019 Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS) &amp;lt;X64&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>How much easier is this than manually installing updates and rebooting or attempting to uninstall and reinstall SQL Server. As SQL Server 2022 isn&amp;rsquo;t out yet I can&amp;rsquo;t say for certain what issues I may encounter but hopefully it will be as easier as this. And I don&amp;rsquo;t need to backup or restore and databases they are all available as before!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>dotnet is 20 years old</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/dotnet-is-20-years-old/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/dotnet-is-20-years-old/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today Microsoft celebrated 20 years since the first version of dotnet was released with a special live stream event.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A lot has happened in the 20 years of dotnet (or .Net). It is my understanding that .Net was created to rival Java. When the .Net Framework was first created it was a windows only thing, but today modern .Net is a modern run anywhere platform, with .net applications running everywhere from PCs and Laptops, Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s, Mobile phones and tablets (via Xamarin Forms), to Websites and Microservice APIs running on every Cloud platform out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to celebrate this achievment tweet with the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dotnetlovesme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DotNetLovesMe&lt;/a>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Thursday the 17th Feb the first preview of dotnet 7.0 is going to be released, with the latest version 6.0 only being released last November.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="History of DotNet" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLj8kj7XEAcW3ng?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=4096x4096" loading="lazy"

Is it to learn new technologies and techniques? Is it to create a following? Is it to educate others? Is it to build some kind of service? Is it some combination of all of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history">History&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#history">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back when the web was young and I was first learning HTML. I hand crafted web pages, adding photos I had taken with captions. If I needed a new page I just added a new html page and linked to it from another page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As time went on I started to learn mysql and php and my website became a hand crafted php nightmare. I also applied what I learned to help my father run the website for his camera club.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point I started playing with WordPress. I have had various WordPress websites or blogs over the years. WordPress is very powerful you can do so many things, install so many plugins. WordPress runs on php and mysql and as my career started to centre around the .net space, I started to want something that was similar, so I could apply things I had learnt to my own website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has led me to the current state of my website. I have a WordPress blog, with most of my oldest content, my newer content lives on dev.to and I have a Blazor webassembly site that uses the dev.to api to run my new website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Blazor webassembly is great, however it has some limitations which I am starting to push against. To host this as cheaply as possible I am using Azure static web apps, so no .net backend all the website is front end. I have some Azure Functions that does the backend bits that I need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google and other bots are not able to find any of my pages except index, due to the way Blazor works. I have got round this by pre rendering the content using &lt;a href="https://prerender.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://prerender.io/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My next difficulty is how to generate a sitemap.xml or a rss feed for my blog. This has started to make me question my architecture decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could use a hosted solution like &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ghost&lt;/a>
which is popular with a some of my peers. This would solve many of the problems I am currently facing but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to play with everything as it is hosted and therefore someone else&amp;rsquo;s problem. How important that is I will look at later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option would be to use github pages, there are quite a few ways to publish a github page, &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo&lt;/a>
appear to be the most popular. Both produce static content and both are a new for me to learn. Interestingly I could also publish either to Azure Static Web apps if github pages ends up not being suitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="split-in-two">Split in two&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#split-in-two">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think my website needs to be split in two. I need a stable blog platform probably using Hugo and github pages. This is what I want to get indexed by the search engines and be the primary way people find out about what I am doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using GitHub Actions</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/using-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/using-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running my website on Azure Static Web Apps for a while and it is pretty cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you create a Static Web App on Azure you get asked for the github repo of your source code and even the branch to use.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Repo for my Static Web App" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/off7ur2tgsla4smkrhhi.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have selected this, you get asked for the type of code to deploy, mine is Blazor Web Assembly but you can use Angular, React or Vue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Actions workflow creation" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ruhzjeujgl1yjxx5lng8.png" loading="lazy"
/>
You now have three variables to fill in the location in your code of the Website, the location of your Azure Functions and the output location usually wwwroot. Once you have set these three you can preview the GitHub Actions file that will be created and added to your repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get something like this&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with github actions, however I have used Azure DevOps quite a bit. Over on the Azure DevOps side I have created a pipeline that deploys to a Dev environment, then a Test environment and finally a production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets have a look at the workflow that I ended up with and with can break down how it all works. Note I am new to Github actions so if there is a better way of doing this do let me know.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The first thing I did was create three Azure Static Web Apps, I am using the free tier so while this is trippling my costs it is all still free! Doing this created three github action workflow files, I deleted two and edited the third, but before I deleted them I made a note of the AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN. If you look in your settings -&amp;gt; secrets for your repo you will see secrets have been created, this is the secure token that github uses to update your static web app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we are in settings we might as well look at environments. I created a Prod, Test and Dev environment that I was going to use in my github actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Environments can have various rules setup on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Required reviewers - this is like an approver, a user specified here must aprove for the workflow to be deployed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait time - I didn&amp;rsquo;t use this, but it looks like a certain amount of time can be set to pause the deployment. (I assume to do some kind of manual check)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployment Branch - specify what branch are allowed to be deployed to what environments. I specified develop, main and feature branches could be deployed to the Dev environment, develop and main could go on Test and main could go on Prod&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Environment secrets - I didn&amp;rsquo;t use this as my secrets were already created, however it looks like your secrets can be associated with a specific environment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now that we have the static web apps setup and the environments lets look at the github action file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all I removed the PR stuff and just concentrated on pushes. I wanted my workflow to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Push to feature branch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Dev env&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PR feature branch to develop&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once merged code gets pushed into develop&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Test env&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PR develop to main&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once merged code gets pushed into main&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Prod env (after approval)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The approval on deploying to production I think is probably overkill, but I still have it setup like that for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My gh action has three jobs defined as dev: test: and prod: they are all the same except they have the azure_static_web_apps_api_token that is correct for their environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also each have a environment defined eg&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>environment:
name: Prod
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Lastly Test and Prod have an if test setup, if the test is false the job won&amp;rsquo;t run. Importantly it won&amp;rsquo;t fail it just won&amp;rsquo;t run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Prod this needs to only run on main branch so we have&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if: github.ref == &amp;lsquo;refs/heads/main&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Test this needs to only run on develop so&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if: github.ref == &amp;lsquo;refs/heads/develop&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could have a test for develop to only run on feature/* but I have allowed it to run everytime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is loads more you can do with github actions, but hopefully this gives you a taste of some of the things you can do. I currently have a mix of Azure DevOps and github actions so I will be working on getting github actions to do more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2022 Goals</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022-goals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022-goals/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lets have a look at what my goals were for 2021. I had eight of them, lets look at them one by one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Azure certification&lt;/strong>. In May of this year I sat and passed the Azure Fundamentals exam. I am calling this goal as achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mentoring&lt;/strong>. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything about working with others or mentoring, so not sure I achieved this one. However I do now work in a development team and I have been reviewing others code and having my own reviewed. We have a junior developer and I am enjoying the opportunities I have to work with him and share my wisdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>F#&lt;/strong>. I have done zero work with F# in 2021, so this one I didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cosmos db/Mongo db&lt;/strong>. I have worked with both of these technologies in 2021. I used Cosmos the most with my website, and storing data for it. I used Mongo/Atlas for auditing for a project I did for my previous job. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I was expert in either of these, but I am starting to get a flavour of non SQL Server databases. I should also note that I am using mysql a lot in my latest job, so another non SQL Server technology that I get to use on a daily basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Give a talk&lt;/strong>. I said last year that maybe I would make baby steps towards doing this, and I have. In the interview for my new job I gave a short presentation (I thought it was bad, but others didn&amp;rsquo;t!) I also gave a short introduction to Blazor talk which went down well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mandlebrot Generator&lt;/strong>. Did nothing on this one as well. I may have googled the code but that is as far as I got.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pwned Pass Mobile App&lt;/strong>. I got an increase in users in 2021 and hence it it still running and I still pay for the API key. I am still considering what to do with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time for me&lt;/strong>. Achieved this one, had plenty of time for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="not-a-bad-year-but-what-are-my-goals-for-2022">Not a bad year but what are my goals for 2022?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#not-a-bad-year-but-what-are-my-goals-for-2022">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video&lt;/strong>. I have just purchased a green screen, so my first goal is to learn how to use OBS, how to light myself properly without getting horrible reflections. I have the content for my first talk, the talk I gave at work about Blazor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conference&lt;/strong>. Attend an in person conference. I am booked to attend Scottish Summit, however it has been postponed due to COVID-19.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Blog More&lt;/strong>. I have been neglecting writing blog posts a bit recently, so I want to do more.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Metrics&lt;/strong>. I have been recording various metrics from twitter, github etc and I would like to expand this and make it a service.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile Pic&lt;/strong>. My profile pic is getting a bit old, so it would be nice to update the images I use online and improve my personal brand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the syntax for BASIC, luckily I have been able to find the &lt;a href="http://elborg.dk/books.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manual&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the commands are listed inside so lets see what we can do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx presents you with a command prompt in which you can type text. Back in the 80s we had a tape player to load programs from tape, however I don&amp;rsquo;t have one today so only programs I write can be run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRINT - To write Hello World, you can just type PRINT &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; and Hello World appears on the screen. To Write a program that displays Hello World, you just write the line number first.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 PRINT &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run this you type RUN
To view the code you type LIST&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Edit a specific Line you can use Ctrl+E and type the line number, or you can just write the line out again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CLS - This command clears the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INPUT N - stores text typed by the user and stores it in the variable N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GOTO N - Execution of code continues at Line Number N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Program I wrote with a bit of help from my boys.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 CLS
20 PRINT &amp;quot;What is your Age?&amp;quot;
30 INPUT N
40 IF N&amp;gt;5 AND N&amp;lt;41 THEN PRINT &amp;quot;a good age&amp;quot;
50 ELSE IF N&amp;lt;6 THEN PRINT &amp;quot;a spaceman&amp;quot;
60 ELSE IF N&amp;gt;40 THEN PRINT &amp;quot;too old&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>My 4yo didn&amp;rsquo;t like being &amp;ldquo;too young&amp;rdquo; in the original version, so my 6yo helped me change him to be a &amp;ldquo;spaceman&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not bad and it was fun pair programming with a 6yo, all my typos were quickly spotted, and he easily understood the logic of IF/ELSE/THEN statements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx comes from 1983 and has just 96k of memory. I am very lucky it actually still works, however I have been able to find an emulator so I can write Lynx BASIC from the comfort of my laptop. &lt;a href="https://jynxemulator.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jynxemulator&lt;/a>
, it is also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonathan-markland/Jynx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the ROMs so getting from the website is a better option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The developer experience today is so much nicer than it must have been in the 1980s, however back then distractions must have been much reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No internet or google to get answers to your questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Copy/Paste of text&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Load/Save (unless you have a working disk drive or tape player!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No IDE&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Build or Release process just type RUN&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lone Developer to Senior Developer, my 2021 story</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/lone-developer-to-senior-developer-my-2021-story/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 09:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/lone-developer-to-senior-developer-my-2021-story/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-day-5-of-the-festive-tech-calendar">Welcome to Day 5 of the Festive Tech Calendar!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#welcome-to-day-5-of-the-festive-tech-calendar">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Usually at this time of year I like to take the opportunity to look back on the last 12 months, highlight some of my achievements and make a few goals for the new year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many of you 2021 has been a difficult year, but it has also been a year of change, and I am in a much better place now than at the start of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To tell you my 2021 story I first need to give you a bit of a history lesson about my career. So, lets fire up your flux capacitor (or Tardis of similar value) and journey back to 2006.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="back-to-2006">Back to 2006&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#back-to-2006">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2006 I got my first IT job. My housemate, who was working as an IT Manager for a small Health and Safety Company, suggested I come work with him. I was currently working an admin job with no idea what to do with my life, so I said yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in October 2006 I joined as a member of the IT Team. I worked mainly on first line support, but as the IT department was small, I learnt about all sorts of IT things, from fixing printers, setting up the CEOs BlackBerry mobile phone with emails, administering active directory, writing SQL queries to swapping tapes for the weekly backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company had many faults which I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss here, but the work was varied, and I was always learning something new so I stayed with the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of 2010, the IT Manager resigned, shortly followed by the rest of the IT department. In January 2011 I was IT Manager, I had no staff, plenty of IT problems and no clue what I was doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was an amazing time for me, I learnt how to interview and hire staff, I learnt more about the different systems we used. It was approximately at this point in time that I switched from being exclusively a SysAdmin to starting to learn Development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had been creating simple websites for a while, mainly using PHP and MySQL. But since I started working in IT I learned more and more about databases, SQL Server and writing T-SQL scripts. I was the companies &amp;ldquo;database guy&amp;rdquo;, so the company naturally asked me to do more and more database work. This led to learning other technologies like MS Access and C# so I could do more and solve more of the company&amp;rsquo;s problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the company was small, and I would always be dragged in to fix SysAdmin problems so I never managed to spend 100% of my time doing development, so in 2016 I moved on to my first full time development job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new job was great, but I kept in touch with my old CEO, Ally and helped out with bits of work on the side, writing SQL queries, updating the odd bespoke application.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="back-where-it-all-began">Back where it all began&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#back-where-it-all-began">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2019 I started formulating a plan to go back to my old job as a contract developer. To my amazement Ally almost bit my arm off to get me back, agreeing to all my terms. So, in the summer of 2019 I started full time as a contract developer, mostly working from home with the occasionally meeting in the office and supporting the business with IT issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My second stint with the company was different than my first, I was able to concentrate almost exclusively on development work. As the only developer I was in full control of development, I decided to use dotnet and Blazor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Late in 2019 I was given advanced warning that the company was being sold. In Feb 2020 the company did get sold, the new owners kept me on to finish the project I was working on but made me a permanent member of staff. In March 2020, the whole company began to work from home due to COVID-19, with parts of the business being furloughed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a difficult time; on top of the stress the whole world was feeling from the global pandemic I was trying to assist with various IT integrations that you would expect when any company gets sold.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="january-2021">January 2021&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#january-2021">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is pretty much where you find me in January 2021. I was working remotely developing internal applications with dotnet/Blazor with the occasional Teams meeting to demonstrate what I had built so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working on your own as a developer is great! You start work and can write code all day. There is no daily stand up, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain what you have been working on, or what challenges you are facing. You don&amp;rsquo;t have any process or formality to follow, only what you impose on yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a build/release pipelines in Azure DevOps, I created pull requests that would kick of a build, run my unit tests, and run some static code analysis. I would glance over my PRs but 99% of the time I would approve them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the greatest weakness of working on my own, no one to suggest ideas of better ways of writing code, no one to bounce ideas off, no one to encourage or be encouraged when I figured out something clever or offer to help you overcome a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="redundancy">Redundancy&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#redundancy">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Mid July I was told that the development function was no longer required, and my job was at risk of redundancy. As I was the only one working in development it sounded very much like a done deal. I had a couple of redundancy meetings to attend and I would need to talk through how various applications worked as part of a handover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest I agreed with the decision to make me redundant. New development work was not coming through, although the users of the applications I had developed loved what I had created, upper management were keen to migrate off these systems and use more centrally managed systems. If I was in charge, I would probably have made a similar difficult decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As soon as I found out I was at risk of redundancy I called up a couple of recruitment agents I had spoken to before. They told me that it was a great time to be looking for a job and immediately arranged some interviews for the next week. I also took advantage of social media and asked on twitter if anyone was looking for developers like me. To my surprise this resulted in at least one interview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I stressed in all my conversations with recruiters and companies I spoke with, was that I was looking for a &lt;strong>team&lt;/strong>. I wanted to work in a team, bounce ideas off others, mentor others, learn from others. This was the most important thing I wanted in whatever my next role was going to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other important things for me was continuing to use Azure or similar cloud technologies. However, I always think that the tech stack and technology can be learnt on the job, tech moves so quickly these days that you have to be constantly learning to stay relevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About two weeks after I first found out about my impending redundancy I contacted (or more likely was contacted by) a third recruitment agency. It was this third one that eventually got me a job, however all three were brilliant, and kept me updated and answered all of my questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next few days were packed with phone calls, interviews, tech tests. I had a lot of different types of companies that I spoke with, from Software Consultancy companies, FinTech companies, Energy suppliers, Legal companies and many others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this time of interviews, I can think of only two in person interviews. The rest made use of Teams, Zoom, Google Meet and even Skype (yes at least one company still uses it for video chats!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The usual way the process went was a conversation with the recruiter about a role after which my details were sent to the company, If the company liked the sound of me an initial informal interview was arranged, after that a second more technical interview was held, sometimes there would be a tech test, sometimes it was more technical questions being asked in the interview. Some companies had more stages that this, but this was what I typically encountered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I lost count of the actual number of interviews I had, but I used a spreadsheet to try and keep it all straight in my mind. The last thing I wanted was to ask a question about the wrong company!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="positive-no">Positive No&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#positive-no">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I got plenty of noes from these interviews, however all were phrased as a positive no. That being they liked me as a person but something about my skill or experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. A friend once described me as an odd mix of junior and senior developer. I agree with that statement, I have a lot of experience in some areas and a real lacking in others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common one was working in a team. Being a lone developer is not good for gaining experience working in a team. However, each time I spoke with companies I stressed that the &lt;strong>team&lt;/strong> was what I was looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another weakness of mine is front end. When I am building something, functionality is more important than getting it looking good. I came from a database and backend start, so it is only natural that I am more at home working on these things. Also, my most recent projects are working with Blazor, which is brand new and few companies are doing much with it yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried really hard not to be discouraged by these noes and that the right company was just around the corner. One no hit harder than most. I had an initial chat with the team of a FinTech Company and then there was a second interview with the CTO which I felt had gone OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From what I had heard it ticked a lot of boxes, the team sounded good, with lots of support and development opportunities and they were moving to the Cloud, so my Azure experience sounded ideal. The CTO liked me and thought I would be a good fit, but I was part way between a junior and a senior, so he had gone away to try and make a bespoke role for me, eventually it would be a no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back, it is easy to see, that this was really encouraging. They tried to create a bespoke role for me! However, at the time all I could think about was all the noes I was hearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-job-for-me">The job for me&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-job-for-me">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>About the same time, I had my initial interview with the company I would eventually accept a role with. I kept being told that there was a tech test to do, but for some reason it never got sent to me, so the interview featured a lot of tech questions and they really grilled me. I came away without much of a sense of if it went well or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, they liked me and wanted me to do a presentation at their office. I am rubbish at public speaking and doing presentations, so I thought I will do this presentation, but it is very unlikely they will like what I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The topic of my presentation was how I upskilled a team on a new project or technology. As a lone developer what an earth could I do for a topic like that? I thought about what I had done to upskill myself on various things, however that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really address the question, as they wanted to know more about what I had done to upskill a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought back to a time when I helped get a largely un-version controlled codebase into source control and automated the build and release pipeline using Azure and Azure DevOps. This involved talking to SQL and data developers so could be a better option for a presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived at the office to do my presentation. First of all, I parked next to the factory where all the forklifts were, I was directed to the correct place to park. Then I tried to go to the wrong building, a very helpful employee helped me go to the correct place. I was introduced to the people who would be interviewing me, one of whom I had worked with in the past, who immediately said you should hire this guy, he is an excellent developer! As introductions go, that&amp;rsquo;s not bad!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion the presentation was bad. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a PowerPoint or similar to go with my talk, so I just waffled on for ten minutes about what I had done a few years back about how I helped get source control being used.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-next-day-i-got-the-job-offer">The next day I got the job offer.&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-next-day-i-got-the-job-offer">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was very surprised to get the offer as I thought I had done so badly the day before they would give me another positive no. I took a few hours to think about it, however all my other applications were either not started or waiting for the next stage, so I was 99% sure I would accept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had no idea what to expect when I started, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really ask many questions at the last interview as I was convinced, I was going to get a no after my presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I worked my notice period and at the start of October I started my new job. My contract only arrived the day before I started, so in the days before I started my mind was making up reasons why the job would disappear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The job started with a two-day induction. Things that were covered on the induction were, mental health, sleep cycles, company values, health and safety and of course a bit of form filling and photocopying passports that you would expect on a first day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#conclusion">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Back when I had been job hunting, each time I stressed the importance of team. The company I had joined had an amazing focus on supporting its staff and getting the best from each other. I had got the best possible fit for the kind of team I was looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually when I start a new job, I get a large dose of imposter syndrome. Now, two months after I started, I can say, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get that this time. Maybe it is how the team functions, maybe it is my level of experience, or maybe its just something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am happy in my new job. There is a lot to learn, both technology and how to work well in this team. But I am supported, there are people to ask question, I am contributing almost from day one. I have already shared a brief talk about my experience with Blazor, which went down better than I expected. I am excited to learn what is next for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have read all the way to here, Thank you! This is my story and I hope you have found it interesting. If you are looking for a new role, I would encourage you to focus on the soft skills you are looking for next, if you concentrate on team like I did, there is a good chance you will land in an amazing team.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Deployed a new version of the Pre Qualification questionnaire website for my employers&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Passed Azure Fundamentals Exam&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mongo DB Atlas - experimented with using it for auditing my application&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>SonarCloud - tried to improve the quality of my code&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Azure DevOps API -&amp;gt; built an application to show builds and releases from my Azure DevOps organisation, code is on github&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Experimented with replacing SQL Agent Jobs with Azure Functions, ended up abandoning this project but was a great learning experience&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Played with MS Graph - displaying profile pic from Azure AD but I am the only one in my org with a photo so abandoned this as well&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added a captch to a website to reduce spam&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Charted my Gas and Electricity usage using the Octopus Energy API&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Charted various metrics from services I use, eg twitter followers, github commits, blog posts published&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Started learning react, easily connected it with Azure AD&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Integrated my employers project management system with a postcode API and google maps so can see where in the country different projects are located&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Tested dotnet 6 preview and the latest Visual Studio 2022 preview&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I was made redundant and got a new job&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wrote my first piece of dotnet code to run on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Kept cost of Azure down, by removing unused services, refactoring and optimizing existing services.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Wow, I have done loads this year, what is next?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My road to Certification</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/my-road-to-certification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/my-road-to-certification/</guid><description>&lt;p>So today I sat the Azure Fundamentals Certification Exam and passed!
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eytphopn3inx2x77m9n5.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really pleased with myself at achieving this. It was one of my goals for 2021 so I can tick that off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back in January I booked my first exam, however due to technical problems I didn&amp;rsquo;t get as far as the Exam. In order to be able to sit an exam like this you need a webcam and microphone so you can be monitored remotely to check that you are not cheating. Something in my network was blocking them from seeing my video so it got cancelled before it started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My theory is that either my internet connection was playing up at the time, My Pi Hole was blocking something, or something else on my network was blocking the video feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cancellation put me off Certifications, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to debug the issue and find out exactly what the problem was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months back I won a free Azure Certification for taking part in a skills challenge run by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregor_suttie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Suttie&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pixel_Robots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Hooper&lt;/a>
and this was due to expire at the end of this month so I thought why not book a second exam and see if I can get past the technical problems. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any exam prep as I thought, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get that far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time I connected directly to my router, bypassing most of the network, firewall and other items on my network that could possibly cause an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cleared my desk, took photos of my ID, took pictures of my desk from every orientation, and waited for the technical issues to start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was in a queue waiting for the exam to start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A connection issue has occurred you have been sent to the back of the queue. Oh here we go again!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But no I connected with the invigilator, who asked to confirm my monitors were disconnected and to move my wallet out of reach off my desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we are off, I am answering questions from the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about the questions, but I whizzed through them, most made me think, some I guessed at. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to pass, I thought maybe half marks or just under due to my familiarity with Azure. (I have been using it for years which must count for something!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was wrong I passed comfortably and now I have my first certification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My advice for you if you have been using Azure for a while is to book this exam and see how you do, you may well pass like me. There are plenty of opportunities to get a free exam, attending conferences like Ignite often qualify you for one, look out for challenges and competitions by #AzureFamily people on twitter as they are very encouraging and helpful in your Certification journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes I am thinking about what Certificate to do next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DotNet on a Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have had a Raspberry Pi for a few years and recently I connected it up again, I plugged in the camera and everything worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start off you can view photos from the camera with the raspistill command. With a bit of clever scripting and the crontab I got the Pi taking pictures every 60 seconds. Even managed to take a nice picture of a robin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e21z7vbamy6w6akhhiwd.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However scripting isn&amp;rsquo;t really programming, and I would like to write a bit more code. Dotnet can run everywhere these days and it made sense to see if it would run on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@pete_codes has written a nice guide to getting started with dotnet on a Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/&lt;/a>
This guide and the nuget package &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/&lt;/a>
was all I needed to get started taking pictures with my Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial goal is to take some wildlife pictures, stick my camera to a window and take pictures of what flies/crawls/jumps past the window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code I have written so far is available on github &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the code takes a picture, uploads this file to Azure Blob Storage (so as not to fill up the Pi with too many image files) and deletes the image locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run a dotnet publish -c Release and then cron can run dotnet RaspberryPiDotNet.dll (with full paths to the relevant files)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use crontab to execute the code every 60 seconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My code has an appsetting.json file which has a couple of settings that need completing for my code to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storage: This is the connection string for Azure Blob Storage
LocalPath: This is the path to where the camera will save its photos to, something like /home/pi/ is all you need but feel free to specify what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the photos are in blob storage I plan to display them somewhere, add options to delete what I don&amp;rsquo;t want, maybe do something timelapsey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper release pipeline and this grates on me a bit. I have been doing a mixture of writing code in VS and pushing that to github and then doing git pull on the Pi, and also writing code directly on the Pi. (VS Code can connect via SSH which is pretty cool!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Charting my Energy usage with the Octopus Energy API</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/charting-my-energy-usage-with-the-octopus-energy-api/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/charting-my-energy-usage-with-the-octopus-energy-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/63ep8hp6ipyn2l4emiop.png" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back when I was a kid, I used to record our weekly gas and electricity meter readings in a little notebook. We then typed these reading into a spreadsheet (this was in the pre-Excel days), which allowed plotting as a line graph.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-would-i-go-about-doing-a-similar-thing-today">How would I go about doing a similar thing today?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-would-i-go-about-doing-a-similar-thing-today">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First off, I have a smart meter that submits meter readings every 30 minutes or so. However, I do not know anyway to get access to these readings directly, short of manually recording them like I did 30 years ago!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Octopus Energy have a public API which allows you to pull your consumption readings. The smart meter sends your usage to your energy supplier, in my case Octopus, they then process these readings and allow them to be queried with an API they have created. It is not a direct connection to your data, but it is the next best thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other energy suppliers will hopefully follow this example and allow users access to their consumption data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-api">How do I use the API?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-do-i-use-the-api">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Using the API is straight forward. Octopus supply you with a secret which you use to authenticate against the API with Basic Auth, no password just a username. Then you just need to pass some details of your meters to get an object containing the last few days meter readings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API Docs&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>GET /v1/electricity-meter-points/{mpan}/meters/{serial_number}/consumption/&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GET /v1/gas-meter-points/{mprn}/meters/{serial_number}/consumption/&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>{mpan}/{mprn} of your gas or electricity meter, and {serial_number} is the serial number of the meters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something to be aware of, I initially collected the last days consumption, which worked, however on one day I encountered a gap in the data for electricity. So, I changed to collect and store the last month&amp;rsquo;s data. I can then query this for what I need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually, the last 24 hours of data is available after midnight of that day. e.g. at midnight 2nd March all the data for 1st March should be available. This is not guaranteed so don&amp;rsquo;t rely on it, however I see no problem with having a few days delay between charting your usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still testing this out but so far, I have three charts for gas (and the same for electricity), the first chart covers a 24-hour period, the next covers a day total over 2 weeks, the final chart covers a total for each month (as I write this I have less than a month&amp;rsquo;s worth of data!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the day and 2 weeks charts, I plot a comparison line of the previous period so you can easily compare the current and previous usage. From my limited testing I have already discovered my usage is very similar day to day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another point of interest is that gas consumption is in m^3 and electricity is in kW/h.

One of my favourites is the option for approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two ways you can do approvals Pre and Post deployment. Lets look at both.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pre-deployment-approval">Pre Deployment Approval&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#pre-deployment-approval">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9k6vo6pfv434u7yq3mt4.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets imagine you have a simple deployment pipeline that deploys to a test/development environment before deploying to a production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre Deployment Approval happens immediately before the release so in this example, click in the ellipse before the Prod release step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will get a screen like the above, you can select what users need to approve it and how long approval waits before timing out, the default is 30 days, but I tend to use a shorter time out of 3 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="post-deployment-approval">Post Deployment Approval&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#post-deployment-approval">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/reiulrhinzqyyon6mrqi.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Post Deployment Approval happens immediately after the release so in this example, click in the circle after the Test release step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will get a screen like the above, with the same settings as before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is pretty much all there is to approvals so either option will prompt you to approve before anything gets deployed to your production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deployment-hours">Deployment Hours&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#deployment-hours">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To complicate matters I make use of the following setting to define deployment hours.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/aku2z0dl3m3xkvfvh7wd.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This setting will start the Prod deployment at 3am Mon-Fri.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I configure Post Deployment Approval, as soon as my deploy to Test has completed a request for Approval is sent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I configure Pre Deployment Approval, at 3am Mon-Fri a request for Approval is sent (not ideal if you tend to be asleep at 3am)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it looks like Post Deployment Approval is more useful for my use case. However if you deny approval either in Pre or Post approval this will mark the deployment as failed and show Red in your list of deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/vichyb1srgc1ln85hj0o.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a casual glance it looks like the deployment to Test is failing, it isn&amp;rsquo;t I am just opting to not continue my deployment to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-pipeline">My Pipeline&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#my-pipeline">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9kprp90t59owfmsmqkcp.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how I have my pipeline setup. Deployment happens on Test and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a post approval step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Test an empty stage called Approval runs and that has a post deployment approval, this happens immediately after Test so you get asked straight away for approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prod does not start as I have my deployment hours configured. Once it is time for deployment to Prod to start it executes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now a casual look at my past releases, you can easily see which have been stopped by approval and which have failed due to whatever issue, and which have run all the way through to Prod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And deployments to Prod can only ever run during my defined deployment window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am interested to hear how you have your deployment pipeline setup. Do you make use of Pre or Post Approvals? Do you ensure deployments always happen at specific times?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goals for 2021</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/goals-for-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/goals-for-2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t make any goals for 2020, or if I did, I didn&amp;rsquo;t officially announce them. 2020 has been a hard year for all of us, 2021 is going to be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few ideas for my goals for the year ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Azure certification&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mentoring&lt;/li>
&lt;li>F#&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cosmos db/Mongo db&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give a talk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mandlebrot Generator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pwned Pass Mobile App&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More time for me&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I want to get a certificate to show how much I know. The obvious area for this is Azure. I spend a lot of time playing with Azure, building and deploying to the platform I should be able to get certified in this area. I actually had an exam booked in 2020 but it was an in-person exam so was cancelled when Covid hit. I plan to sit the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foundation&lt;/a>
exam in the first quarter of 2021 and I will take it from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I have had a few times recently where I have been reminded that I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience working with others. Mostly because I work in a one-man development team so there are limited opportunities in the workplace. I have a few ideas to change this, but this is one of my top priorities for 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&amp;amp; 4) My experience is very Microsoft and C# so I want to spend some time exploring and learning tech that is adjacent to this. A functional language like F# sounds like a good compliment to my existing skills and my data skills are also very SQL server so some document database skills would be a good place to spend some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Doing a talk has been on my list for years. I am terrified of doing one and with everything online now I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that makes things easier or harder. I don&amp;rsquo;t think 2021 is going to be the year for this but maybe I will take baby steps towards this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Twitter recently reminded me about watching a Mandlebrot generate one pixel at a time in the 1980s. I would love to explore the code used to generate them and how fast they currently are to produce.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>My Google play store Xamarin forms app that uses the HIBP API has less than 100 users and I am considering closing it down, especially as I pay a monthly fee for API keys. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really decided what to do, maybe I will spend some time improving it, maybe I will close it down, maybe I will build something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For many people 2020 has been a hard year, I am one of those&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Building a Twitter Clone</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/building-a-twitter-clone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/building-a-twitter-clone/</guid><description>&lt;p>I saw a tweet about building a twitter clone being harder than you would think. So this of course started me thinking how I would go about building something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok so where would I start? First a few assumptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Development by a lone developer ie me&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tech stack will be dotnet and other tech I am familiar with&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Database backend, probably SQL Server but I might use table storage for cost reasons should I try and actually build this. However if I design this well this should be something that could be swapped out as the system grows&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User accounts on the system will be small as I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine anyone ever signing up. Why sign up to a social media platform with no users?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="i-guess-the-next-question-is-what-is-twitter">I guess the next question is what is Twitter?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#i-guess-the-next-question-is-what-is-twitter">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A website that allows you to share 280 characters of text with your followers, allows you to follow other users updates and allows other user to follow your updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also has an API that allow you to do almost everything that you can with the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there are of course mobile apps to consider but I am going to assume this is out of scope, however assuming a good enough API then this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem for future development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first-steps">First Steps&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#first-steps">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To start off with I would concentrate on the API, and then build a web client that makes use of the API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what would my MVP (minimum viable product) be?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>User can authenticate with my API to get a token which allows access to other API endpoints&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can create a tweet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can view own tweets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can view tweets of another user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can view tweets in their timeline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can follow/unfollow other users&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can search for other users&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can search for keywords in tweets&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I think that is probably sufficient to build my MVP for the API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting side note is that I could use the OAuth Twitter authentication to allow users to login to my twitter clone with the real twitter login details. However this makes no sense to me as we are essentially adding a dependency on the real twitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what would I use for the frontend? I would start off with a Client Side Blazor frontend. Once I had a proof of concept that worked, I would think about styling and adding the UI elements that are familiar to twitter users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beauty of Client Side Blazor is that I can host cheaply in azure storage and distribute around the world via a CDN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the high number of times that follower and following count and other stats are queried I would consider storing these in the database and include a regular job to recalculate them so they don&amp;rsquo;t get out of sync with the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said all of this I am very tempted to fire up Visual Studio and see how far I get, and what problems I encounter along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#005: Twitter Cards</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/005-twitter-cards/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/005-twitter-cards/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been a bit of a mad week this week. I joined a new team so lots of time learning what&amp;rsquo;s what and also being pulled in two directions as usual demands come through on top of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My blog runs on Blazor and I have been making use of JavaScript interop to update the html headers and update the page title to match the blog post article. This works great, I load the page and check the headers and they were saying what I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem was I wanted to add tags for &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter cards&lt;/a>
This means that when I paste a link to my blog on twitter you get a nice preview and pic of me in the tweet. This was not working at all even though I had the correct headers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I eventually figured out that the problem was the fact I was using JavaScript to update my headers after the page had been initially loaded. Twitter was fetching my page before these headers got added and therefore couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the twitter card headers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My solution was to use invalid html. Not ideal but it works. I added the required html tags in the body of my page using Blazor/C# instead of using JavaScript to add them into the header. Twitter appears to not be fussy in finding them in the wrong place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twitter provides a validator tool at &lt;a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Card Validator&lt;/a>
which my website now passes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not much else to say this week, apart from I am missing Visual Studio and C#, I have been mostly using VS Code on Linux and looking at php which isn&amp;rsquo;t as much fun as my usual day job.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update #004</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/weekly-update-004/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/weekly-update-004/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use sp_send_dbmail to send results of sql queries by email to business users. Recently an issue was raised that data was being cut off after 255 characters. To fix this I added @query_no_truncate = 1, however this stopped the column headings from being included. No idea why you can&amp;rsquo;t have all the data and column headings but there you have it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I am doing now is running 2 queries, one to get the headings, and one to get the data. In theory you should be able to combine them with a Union however you then have datatype issues for non text columns so I gave up with that idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My results have 60 something columns (don&amp;rsquo;t ask its for a data import into a third party system!) so I am not typing them all out. I can shove query results into a temporary table and then execute to get a list of columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT&lt;/span> name

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However I need my list to be horizontal so I can use as column headers. I can use dynamic SQL and a pivot to flip them round.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DECLARE&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">@&lt;/span>cols &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">AS&lt;/span> NVARCHAR(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">MAX&lt;/span>), &lt;span style="color:#f92672">@&lt;/span>query &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">AS&lt;/span> NVARCHAR(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">MAX&lt;/span>)

&lt;h3 id="my-first-pr">My First PR&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#my-first-pr">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A comment was made to me to do something with the postcodes that are in the system I am developing. Find out what projects have postcodes near each other, and that way work can be grouped together and reduce potential mileage costs of staff that need to visit these projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick google search found &lt;a href="https://postcodes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://postcodes.io/&lt;/a>
which has an API that returns nearby postcodes. It also has a C# wrapper &lt;a href="https://github.com/markembling/MarkEmbling.PostcodesIO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/markembling/MarkEmbling.PostcodesIO&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A comparison of what was being returned from the wrapper and what the API said should be returned revealed that the distance between postcodes wasn&amp;rsquo;t being returned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the code was on GitHub I could easily see how easy or difficult it might be to add the missing bit of information. It was easy! So, I forked the repo and made the change. I published the change to a private NuGet repo in my Azure Dev Ops account. That way I could try my revised package to check it did what I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left a message on the GitHub project letting the owner know I had a potential fix for an issue. The project hadn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in over a year, so the owner may not be interested, or the project may have been abandoned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was in luck just 17 hours after I left a message the project owner said to create a Pull Request, which I did and shortly afterwards my code had been merged in and an updated version of the package existed in the public NuGet feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been thinking about contributing to open source for a while. However, I had not seen a project I wanted to contribute to, or a problem that I knew how to fix until now that is.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="php">PHP&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#php">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This week I had a call asking me if I knew PHP?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did, over ten years ago, before I got my first IT job, I spent time learning PHP and MySQL. I created a blog, and I also created a website for my Dad&amp;rsquo;s camera club. The code I created back then was awful. No shared code, all the code was associated with the page, or sorts of bugs occurred and as time went by it became increasingly hard to update. The site was well liked but I eventually lost interest and moved on to learn other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This call led to me talking with the head of IT, and later a couple of the developers who have since granted me access to the codebase of a project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to spend a lot of time looking at the code so far, however this is nothing like the PHP I had built before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project makes use of the &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laravel&lt;/a>
framework and the first file I opened had methods and classes, so apart from the syntax you could think you were looking at C#.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that interested me was the project used docker containers, it has automated builds as well. Lots of modern programming ideas that I had some ideas about. I am looking forward to learning more about this project and how I might contribute to it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update #002</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/weekly-update-002/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/weekly-update-002/</guid><description>&lt;p>I know Active Directory is fussy about clocks being in sync however not sure how todays issue happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I run my docker compose file from Visual Studio and I get a weird error.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>SecurityTokenNotYetValidException: IDX10222: Lifetime validation failed. The token is not yet valid. ValidFrom: 'System.DateTime', Current time: 'System.DateTime'.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I deleted my containers, open and close Visual Studio a few times, nothing helps. Eventually I think to find out what the time is on my container. It has yesterday&amp;rsquo;s date. What has happened here? Surely recreating containers would have caused them to have todays date? I reboot and everything is fine again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out that it is a know issue, see &lt;a href="https://thorsten-hans.com/docker-on-windows-fix-time-synchronization-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://thorsten-hans.com/docker-on-windows-fix-time-synchronization-issue&lt;/a>
I am using WSL2 and I have now changed back to using Hyper-V and the issue hasn&amp;rsquo;t come back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier in the week I spotted my build step was failing.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"> - &lt;span style="color:#f92672">task&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">NuGetToolInstaller@0&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Swapping to the next version of the step is all I needed to do to fix it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"> - &lt;span style="color:#f92672">task&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">NuGetToolInstaller@1&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>My guess is that support was dropped for this earlier version or there is some other incompatability with .Net 5.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update #001</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/weekly-update-001/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/weekly-update-001/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my favourite podcasts is Troy Hunts weekly update. In it he discusses stuff that he has been working on, plus some personal stuff. I am going to attempt to do something similar. It will probably take me a few of these before we get a look and feel that works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="monday">Monday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#monday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A week off work, mainly to use it up before year end, plus want to get a few jobs around the house done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did ask the following question on Twitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/azurefamily?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#azurefamily&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dotnet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#dotnet&lt;/a> developers how do I get more involved in mentoring?&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Simon Foster (@funkysi1701) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/funkysi1701/status/1325742644014829568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2020&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>As a one person dev team, my biggest weakness is working with others so any ideas of how to change that are great.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tuesday">Tuesday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#tuesday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Dotnet 5 is out! The latest version of dotnet is released by Microsoft and to celebrate there is &lt;a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dotnetconf&lt;/a>
to listen to. Due to time zones and family commitments, I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to an awful lot of it but I did see the keynote and loved the 3 Scott&amp;rsquo;s chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#wednesday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My youngest son was 3 today, due to Coronavirus we didn&amp;rsquo;t do much but we celebrated as a family, and he even had a zoom call.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thursday">Thursday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#thursday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Blazor has a new feature &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/virtualization?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtualize&lt;/a>
where a list of items can only load the ones on screen. I have been trying to get this to work on my blog, works great running locally but not working in production yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think I know what might be happening. I use Cloudflare to do my SSL, as Custom SSL certs for the cheaper Azure Web Apps is not supported. Something in Cloudflare is caching or interfering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://zimmergren.net/solved-asp-net-core-blazor-web-sites-does-not-work-with-cloudflare-html-minification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://zimmergren.net/solved-asp-net-core-blazor-web-sites-does-not-work-with-cloudflare-html-minification/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turning off HTML minification fixed my issue!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One additional thing I added to my Blog is the &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/config">/config&lt;/a>
page which details some of the config settings. I think this probably came from &lt;a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/adding-a-git-commit-hash-and-azure-devops-build-number-and-build-id-to-an-aspnet-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.hanselman.com/blog/adding-a-git-commit-hash-and-azure-devops-build-number-and-build-id-to-an-aspnet-website&lt;/a>
but it was a while ago when I first did this on another project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment we have .net Version, Commit and Build links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The .Net Version is obtained from&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">@System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.FrameworkDescription
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>A few other bits of info can be obtained from System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation which I have included on the page for fun. There are probably security concerns with exposing all this info publicly so something to bear in mind if you try this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Build Info is passed to my code by a build step&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">- &lt;span style="color:#f92672">script&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;(echo $(Build.BuildNumber) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo $(Build.BuildId)) &amp;gt; .buildinfo.json&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">displayName&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Emit build number&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">workingDirectory&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/src/WebBlog&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">failOnStderr&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This simply passed the build id and number which are stored as variabled and saves them in a text file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then have a class that reads them and constructs a link.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

&lt;p>Head on over to &lt;a href="https://securityheaders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://securityheaders.com/&lt;/a>
This is a site created by security expert &lt;a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Helme&lt;/a>
that rates a URL based on what response headers it can see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am pleased to say &lt;a href="http://www.funkysi1701.com">www.funkysi1701.com&lt;/a>
is now getting an A.&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/07rwumi94fz141hwessu.PNG" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how do you add/remove headers in dotnet core?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my configure method in Startup.cs I have the following code block.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">app.Use(

{
context.Response.OnStarting(
() =&amp;gt;
{
context.Response.Headers.Add(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Permissions-Policy&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;microphone=()&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
context.Response.Headers.Remove(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Server&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
context.Response.Headers.Remove(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;X-Powered-By&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
context.Response.Headers.Remove(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;X-AspNet-Version&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Task.CompletedTask;
});
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> next(context);
};
});
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have only included a few of the headers I am adding as the excellent &lt;a href="https://securityheaders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://securityheaders.com/&lt;/a>

&lt;p>Covid 19 has hit the world, and I will be honest I have found it a challenging time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Blog had gotten into a bit of a mess. It had become fragmented with different versions of the same thing; I will attempt to explain what has become of my blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original WordPress site can currently be found at &lt;a href="https://www.pwnedpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.pwnedpass.com/&lt;/a>
I would prefer it to be on a sub-domain of funkysi1701.com but for some reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get that to work, not sure if it is a limitation of my hosting package. I like WordPress, it is very flexible, easy to get blog posts out there. But I want to write content about development and having a site I can tinker with is important to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of my WordPress blogs have been imported into dev.to and a few extra have been written on this platform. I like dev.to it is a wonderful place to share content and it has one or two extra features I like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>dev.to has an integration with Stackbit/Netlify and this became &lt;a href="https://dev.funkysi1701.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dev.funkysi1701.com&lt;/a>
. I like having a personal site, but having the same content as dev.to. To add content to this site all I need to do is write it on dev.to and some magic will go on behind the scenes and new content will be published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as a developer I don&amp;rsquo;t like magic, I want to understand what is going on a fiddle with all the settings and make it do what I want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>dev.to has an API, I can build a site in .Net Core and make API calls to fetch the content I want. I understand APIs, I understand .Net and can customise my site exactly how I want it, plus play about with a .net website. This is what &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com">https://www.funkysi1701.com&lt;/a>
is now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what have I built so far. I have a Server Side Blazor site running .Net 5. Why Server Side and not Client Side I hear you ask? Well only because I have more experience with Server Side and know how to quickly create a website with that technology, I may change it as time goes by, but we will see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have two pages a list of my blog posts and a page that displays the content. Both of these use the dev.to API. I lied, there is a third page I hacked together to do some page redirection from the WordPress URLs. This is something I will change as time goes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of improvements I want to do, there are probably also lots of broken images or links as well. Hopefully, this will result in a good platform to blog about as well as on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing for expiring SSL Certificates</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/testing-for-expiring-ssl-certificates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/testing-for-expiring-ssl-certificates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is amazing, you can easily add SSL certificates to any website and automate the renewal process. I have talked &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/let-s-encrypt-is-awesome-3f5j/">before&lt;/a>
about how impressive it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you start adding SSL certificates to your production sites however you may want to check when they expire so you don&amp;rsquo;t get caught out. You can always open your site in your favourite browser and view the certificate information and expiry date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="SSL Cert" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jb78re4fmm1ofx81f3mu.JPG" loading="lazy"
/>
However there is a way to automate this check.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[Fact]&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> IsSSLExpiring()
{
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> handler = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> HttpClientHandler
{
ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = CustomCallback
};
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> HttpClient(handler);
HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.example.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
Assert.True(response.IsSuccessStatusCode);
}
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">bool&lt;/span> CustomCallback(HttpRequestMessage arg1, X509Certificate2 arg2, X509Chain arg3, SslPolicyErrors arg4)
{
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> now = DateTime.UtcNow;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> expire = arg2.NotAfter;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> diff = (expire - now).TotalDays;
Assert.InRange(diff, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">30&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1000&lt;/span>);
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> arg4 == SslPolicyErrors.None;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This code gets the SSL expiry date from &lt;a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.example.com&lt;/a>
and will fail the xunit test if the expiry date is less than 30 days in the future. I then schedule my tests to run regularly on all my environments with a Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Certificate and this gives me advanced warning if a SSL certificate is about to expire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Assert.InRange(diff, 30, 1000) line will fail the test if the expiry date is less than 30 days or greater than 1000, but as the default expiry for Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt certificates is three months it will never be greater than 1000 days even with a freshly installed certificate. These values can be tweaked to suit your use case, however 30 days is enough time for me to investigate what is happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To execute my tests I use a scheduled build in Azure DevOps, but anything that regularly can run your tests will do the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code above is just a simple example to get your started for my purposes I have put all my URLs into config files and just pass these into my tests, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need a custom test for every different URL.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gated Release</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/gated-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/gated-release/</guid><description>&lt;p>Automated releases of software are great but how can we add an element of feedback so only good releases go live.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been using Azure DevOps to release my &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/pwned-pass/">PwnedPass&lt;/a>
android app to the Google Play Store for a while now. There are options to deploy to the alpha, Beta or Production tracks and even to set % of users to target. For the full range of options check out the Google Play &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension&lt;/a>
for Azure DevOps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My release starts by publishing to 10% of users on the production track, my next step makes use of the increase rollout option to increase this %, you can have as many of these additional steps as you want until you reach 100% of your users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image.png?fit=662%2C116&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you run this release now it will just run through each of the steps one after the other. Now of course you can add a pre or post approval to your pipeline but this just adds a manual dependency to your release. Whoever does the approving needs to check things are working before approving or worse just approves regardless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure DevOps has the concept of &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/deploy-using-approvals?view=azure-devops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gated releases&lt;/a>
which allows you to add automated checks before or after a release happens. These automated checks can be any of the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An Azure Function&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Rest API call&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Azure Monitor Alert&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Query Work Items&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security and Compliance Assessment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are going to make use of the Azure Monitor Alert, to create an alert from your Application Insights data and only continue the rollout if no failures are detected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open up your application insights resource in the Azure portal and look in alerts. Click add new alert rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-1.png?fit=662%2C552&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select your application insights resource in Resource, In Condition choose a condition to check, I chose Failed Requests, so every time a failure is registered in my API I can stop the deployment. The exact criteria you want to use is entirely up to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create an action group, I just set my alert to send an email to myself but there are other alert actions you may want to try. Give your alert a name and description and click save.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all we need to do is make Azure DevOps make use of this alert. In your release pipeline select the pre-deployment conditions of your second step and open up the Gates section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-2.png?fit=662%2C498&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a suitable time to evaluate, I have been using something long like 12 or 24 hours so if there are problems there is time for it to be noticed. Choose Version 1 of the task (I was not able to get it to work with Version 0)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now select your Azure subscription and Resource Group and leave the rest of the settings as they are. Now your Deployment will stop and analyse application insights for any Failed requests and will halt if it finds any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-3.png?fit=662%2C88&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still testing this out but it will take a few days to figure out if this what I want due to the large time scales involved. I feel this is going to be an improvement of manually approving release steps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pwned Pass Update</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/pwned-pass-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/pwned-pass-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Its been a while since I first released Pwned Pass so lets have a look at where we are now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are very close to 500 Downloads from &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play&lt;/a>
and we have recently smashed past 100 active installs, peaking at 116 and even now we are still over 100. I have had 9 reviews (6 x 5*, 2 x 1 * and a 4 *) which averages out at 4 *
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image.png?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
Over Christmas I released a UWP version that can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NM2WHNZTNLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store&lt;/a>
. This has currently had 9 downloads and even had a download to windows mobile (someone out there still likes the platform!)
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1.png?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
I have a fairly smooth deployment process using Azure DevOps. After every check in of code a build runs which compiles the UWP and Android versions. The build also increments the version numbers that is required to deploy to either of the app stores.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every successful build of the master branch will kick off a release to the Beta track of Google Play. If I am happy I then release to 10% of the Production track, which can then be increased to 100% (or halted). The release to Microsoft Store happens after the Beta track of Google Play. Only reason for this order is that there isn’t a beta area for UWP apps so I want to quickly test change on android before rolling out for windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these steps require confirmation by me before proceeding and often don’t get further than the beta track.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A further development is that I have open sourced the source code to &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/PwnedPass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
do take a look if you are curious or want to contribute. With the purchase by Microsoft there are easy ways to connect github repositories to Azure DevOps. Once I create a Pull Request in github it creates a build in Azure DevOps and all the build and release steps can happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still not 100% sure if I want to keep my bug and issue tracking in github or Azure DevOps as both have features for doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One future improvement I want to make is to automate the creation of screenshots. When I create a new feature and it gets checked in. I would like to automatically created screenshots of the key pages and submit them to the different app stores. Currently I am not sure if this is possible or how to go about it. I have some ideas to experiment with so we will see what I can do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lets see what 2019 can do!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/lets-see-what-2019-can-do/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/lets-see-what-2019-can-do/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my annual lets make some goals for the new year blog post. So in no particular order.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="improve-house">Improve House&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#improve-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I can’t outdo last years goal of buying a house but I can continue to make efforts to improve it. I was going to put something about decorating or doing something to our bedrooms, however today I spotted a hole in the roof so this may well absorb most of my home improvement budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="connect-with-local-area">Connect with local area&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#connect-with-local-area">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since we moved in October we haven’t really connected with our local area yet. My only interaction with my neighbours was when my car blocked his drive!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to make efforts to change this in 2019. I don’t exactly know how yet, but I have some ideas. My son starts nursery and later school this year so could be one way to meet other parents and teachers. I want to connect with a local church, so far this hasn’t happened so need to make more effort with this. There are other local groups that put on child friendly events which would be good to attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I failed last year to do this so it is back on my list. I know I must have stuff of value to share so going to try again on this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lightning talk is a very short talk or presentation given at a conference or user group. I am not a natural public speaker so this is a step out of my comfort zone, however I am going to start small and see what happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>##Family Holiday
As always we Fosters are going to have a holiday in the summer and have some quality family time. I also want to take the boys to London for a weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="blogging">Blogging&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#blogging">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This blog has taken a bit of a backseat in 2018 so I want to try and refocus it for 2019. My commitment is for 12 blog posts in 2019, that is one a month. It doesn’t sound like much but I know how easily life can get in the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said that my log has had record views this year. 7159 views. However I believe this number to be incorrect and has been inflated by my app development and some of the automated processes taking place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="routine">Routine&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#routine">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last goal is to try a get more of a routine going. With two small boys, one of which is starting school in September a routine is going to be essential and will allow all of us all a chance to get more things done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Async and Await</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/async-and-await/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/async-and-await/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while the Async and Await commands in c# have confused me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like most things the best way to learn about something is to use it in a real world example. I am currently adding an email alert feature to a website. This is an ideal example of something that would benefit from Asynchronous programming. There is no need for the webpage to wait to send 1000s of emails, lets just send a call to get started and allow the browser to carry on as normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my first try at using async and await so feel free to suggest best practises in the comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start with a Send method in my EmailController.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> ActionResult Send(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> id, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> pageId, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> userID)

}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This simply checks to see if you have permission to the page. If not redirects to the login page otherwise it makes a method call and redirects back to the page it came from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets have a look at that method call in more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Task&lt;string> t = SendNotification(id, userid);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SendNotification doesn’t return a normal string it returns a Task&lt;string>, so lets look at how we are creating this.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The return type is set to Task but it has the aysnc keyword appended to it. It also makes a call with the await keyword.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task SendEmail(EmailModel model,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> emailHtmlBody)
{
&lt;span style="color:#75715e">//logic removed
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> smtp.SendMailAsync(message);
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So that is it. My first bit of code that uses Async and Await. My controller calls a method asynchronously which then calls another method asynchronously which sends emails asynchronously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Async – This enables the Await keyword to be used in the method&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Await – This is where things get asynchronous. The await keyword allows the code to wait asynchronously for the long running code to complete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uploading Files to AWS</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/uploading-files-to-aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/uploading-files-to-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a fan of Azure but today I have been looking at AWS. Specifically how to upload and download files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS S3 stores files in Buckets. I already had an AWS S3 account setup with a Bucket. I am going to assume you have got a bucket setup and concentrate on the code to get files in and out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First step is to use nuget to install the AWS packages. In nuget the packages you want are called AWSSDK.Core and AWSSDK.S3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The using statements you want to use are called Amazon.S3 and Amazon.S3.Transfer, not sure why this doesn’t match nuget, this difference caught me out a couple of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to the code that uploads files&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
{
TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
{
BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
InputStream = streamWriter,
Key = fileName
};
fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Lets break it down and look at what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of AmazonS3Client, we are passing the Access Key and Secret Access Key both of which can be found from your Amazon S3 account My Security Credentials section. Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1 specifies the amazon data centres that your bucket is located in.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of TransfterUtility using the AmazonS3Client instance we created in the previous step.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
{
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This opens up a filestream from a files path and specifies that the file should be opened.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
{
BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
InputStream = streamWriter,
Key = fileName
};
fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This last step specifies which bucket to upload to, what input stream to upload and the Key to use. Key is just AWS way of referring to files, more commonly referred to as the filename.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all you need to do to upload a file to your Bucket. The file will be located at &lt;a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]&lt;/a>
, however by default it will not be downloadable until you set Read permission to everyone, once you do that anyone who has the link will be able to download your file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the same permission level as any file you have on your webserver, however AWS has a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (s3Client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1))
{
GetPreSignedUrlRequest request1 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> GetPreSignedUrlRequest
{
BucketName = bucketName,
Key = filename,
Expires = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">5&lt;/span>)
};
urlString = s3Client.GetPreSignedURL(request1);
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we are generating a url to download the file, but we are specifying that it is only valid for 5 minutes. This means that if you share the url it will only work for 5 minutes, after that AWS will give an access denied message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is much better security than you have on a typical web server, and easy to implement, every time a user clicks on a download link you generate a new presigned url and send the download to the browser, as long as this process doesn’t take longer than 5 minutes the user will never know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Azure WebJobs to Automate Stuff</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</guid><description>&lt;p>I keep hearing about Azure WebJobs but I have never used them. Time to change this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that can run a script at a specific time. In my case I would like to hit a specific url of my website at the same time every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="WebJobs" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/addkeepalivewebjob.png?resize=313%2C615&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
To the right you can see an example of the WebJobs form on the Azure portal that you need to fill in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to supply a name for your webjob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to upload the script that will run in my case I used a powershell script. My script consisted of which basically just loads the url specified.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">$progressPreference = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;silentlyContinue&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
$result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri (&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.google.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>) -Method Get -UseBasicParsing;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Type refers to if your job will be triggered or run continuously, I want it to be triggered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Triggers refers to if you want it to be scheduled or manual, something that you can run on an ad hoc basis. I of course want scheduled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are familiar with the linux CRON then the next box will make sense to you for everyone else I will try and make sense of it. The box consists of 6 numbers which can either have a value or a *. The numbers correspond to the following {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hourly job would be expressed as 0 0 * * * *, ie every day of week, every month, every day, every hour and only when minute and second equals zero. For more help with this check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs#CreateScheduledCRON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSDN docs&lt;/a>
about it. I want to use 0 30 21 * * * to run daily at 9.30pm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it everything setup, now time to wait and see if it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Oh no!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It failed to run at the specified time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason for this is the scheduler requires the feature Always On to be turned on which is not available in the free App Service. Before you reach for your wallets, I found a solution on this &lt;a href="https://tomssl.com/2016/12/20/how-to-get-azure-webjobs-to-run-indefinitely-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
that allows them to run on the free tier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thinking behind this solution is you need to keep the website alive throughout the day so Tom has created a script that does this. His script can be found on his blog or on his &lt;a href="https://github.com/TomChantler/Self-KeepAlive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github page&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set this script up to run every 5 minutes (0 */5 * * * *) like the example above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nextthing you need to do is create a Custom connection string in the Application Settings blade called SecretThing. Tom’s script references this to access the website and keep it alive. The password you need to put in SecretThing can be found in you publish profile (downloaded from the Overview blade in the Azure portal). For more details and a better explanation check out &lt;a href="https://tomssl.com/2016/12/20/how-to-get-azure-webjobs-to-run-indefinitely-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom’s blog&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last thing to mention about WebJobs is that you can see details about when they have run at https://[YourWebAppName].scm.azurewebsites.net/azurejobs/#/jobs and this can be a great place to help debug your scripts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fiddler and APIs</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/fiddler-and-apis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/fiddler-and-apis/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while ago I blogged about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2017/04/17/automation-promotion/">promoting&lt;/a>
my blog with Buffer. At the time I made use of the nuget package &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BufferAPI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BufferAPI&lt;/a>
but lets look at some improvements I can make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The BufferAPI package worked great from my console app, but when I tried to use it from a Controller in an MVC app I never got it to work. Lets look at the API docs and see if I can rewrite it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two main types of API calls GET which gets data from the server and POST which posts data to the server. These come from the types of HTTP requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6wozrfdoqvtjaoxs7j1v.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quickly figured out how to use the GET API call to authenticate using &lt;a href="https://api.bufferapp.com/1/profiles.json?access_token=XXXX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.bufferapp.com/1/profiles.json?access_token=XXXX&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However POST was defeating me. That was until I remembered &lt;a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiddler&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had heard Troy Hunt (and others) talk of using Fiddler to examine what data is being passed among websites. Troy uses it to do a man in the middle test to see what information can be stolen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is really easy to setup, install Fiddler, click yes to a few security warnings and you can see what information is being passed from your code to remote APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I had Fiddler installed I could compare what information is being passed between a successful API call using the BufferAPI nuget package and an unsuccessful API call using my code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiddler also showed that passing my authentication token in a POST request is much better. Despite both GET and POST being encrypted when using HTTPS, anything at either end that logs URLs will have a log of your username and password.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have not tried Fiddler, give it a try especially if you are doing things with API calls.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How do I add Power BI data to a webpage?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/how-do-i-add-power-bi-data-to-a-webpage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/how-do-i-add-power-bi-data-to-a-webpage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I talked about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2017/06/05/businessintelligence/">Power BI&lt;/a>
, what it is and some of the different services you can use with it. This week lets add some of that data to a simple web page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this example I am going to add the google analytics data from this website to this page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First login to your Power BI &lt;a href="https://app.powerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://app.powerbi.com/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click the get data link at the bottom left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click My Organisation to bring up the app search box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46c1lyxy053xcq66fowf.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click the Apps tab and search for “google” in the search box, you should then see Google Analytics, click into this and then click the get it now button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Log into your google account. If you have multiple google accounts I found it worked best to sign out of all of them or run this in an incognito window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are signed in you should see a list of the different google analytics data you have, select the one you want to use and click import.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Power BI will then go away and start loading the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once loaded go to Reports and select the Google Analytics that has been loaded. If you have more than one, it is a good idea to rename each one eg Corporate Site Google Analytics, Blog Google Analytics so you won’t get mixed up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the file menu select Publish to web and agree that you are OK for this to be made public.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will then be given a piece of HTML code that starts with &amp;lt;iframe copy this onto your web page. Reload your webpage and you should see something similar to mine below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be noted that while you can but the webpage containing the iframe behind a login page, the data could still be accessed if you knew the url contained within the iframe, this is why the link can be emailed and continue to work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon Web Services</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/amazon-web-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/amazon-web-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a big fan of Azure but I know zero about its biggest rival – Amazon Web Services or AWS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So lets sign up for a free trial and see what it can do. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Amazon Web Services" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aws-300x169.png?resize=300%2C169" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AWS free trial is available from &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/free/&lt;/a>
and lasts for 12 months. From memory I think the Azure free trial lasted only one month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start you need to login with your amazon account and create an AWS account. This requires your name and address and your payment info (you will only get billed if use services not covered by your free trial).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly AWS requires you to verify your identity via an automated phone call. (I don’t recall doing anything like this for Azure but please correct me if I am wrong.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are logged in you get a series of links displaying all the different services that are available. First impression is this is a simpler view to Azure’s portal with a similar amount of services. At the top right is an option to select which region you want to use, in Azure I use North Europe and West Europe, AWS has Ireland and Frankfurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-web-app">Create a Web App&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#create-a-web-app">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First thing to try is setting up a website. I selected create a web app and I get a page asking me for its basic details (very similar to Azure, however AWS asked what language your code is written in, Azure handles all of these) AWS websites appear to support a host of different options similar to Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The actual creation of your website takes a few moments (like on Azure). However the default URL for websites is similar to &lt;a href="http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/&lt;/a>
which is not quite as nice as the Azure equivalent &lt;a href="http://test.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.azurewebsites.net&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure has a host of command lines available via powershell. AWS has a similar command line interface called AWS CLI, including the option to deploy from git to your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is an extension that allows for the publishing of websites to AWS. (Just like you can publish to Azure)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I learn more about AWS I will continue to blog about it. &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/08/04/amazon-web-services-pt-2/">Amazon Web Services Pt 2&lt;/a>

&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="100-posts-old-L-fwCF_f" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/100-posts-old-L-fwCF_f-300x247.jpeg?resize=300%2C247" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So what have I learned in the past 100 posts?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It is easier to write a blog before you become a parent. More recently I am increasingly finding it difficult to find the time to blog. It used to be that I could write on an evening, but now James is around I often prefer to play with him, or more often stop him crawling where he shouldn’t.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like my job. The inspiration for most of this site is my day job and as you can read, I do a wide variety of different things, but I have a lot more to learn as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finding your niche is hard. 100 posts in and I am still not sure what my niche is. I started out with the broad niche of IT and what I do, I then considered something about IT and fatherhood but I don’t think that topic is really me. My current thinking is maybe DevOps especially as my role these days fits squarely between Development and Operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Its time for a refresh. I have been meaning to change the theme of this site for some time and I feel after 100 posts now is as good as time as any. I want to emphasise my skills and what I am learning and increase the emphasis on DevOps, which I think will be my niche.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching visitor numbers is addictive. Every day I look at how many people have looked at my blog, but I have yet to see a pattern between what I write and how many reads I get. Is my writing getting better? I don’t know. Are more people reading? Probably not. Will I keep going? Yes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So what is next?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully a refreshed look in the next few months. Hopefully regular posts. If there is something you want to see on here drop me a message via any of the social media links or put a comment below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is my favourite post?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/05/30/user-groups-and-f/">User Groups and F#&lt;/a>
which proved very popular and got me to start going to user groups something I still enjoy today. I also like &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/02/25/coding-myself-into-a-corner/">Coding Myself Into A Corner&lt;/a>
which got me to start thinking more if I was giving myself future problems. But there are many others I like such as &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/09/03/baby-magic-and-becoming-a-father/">James and Becoming a father&lt;/a>

Lots of fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week unfortunately Azure had some problems and many websites that were running in the North Europe data centre were unavailable for several hours. And you guessed it my websites were hosted here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All hosting providers are going to have downtime from time to time and this is just something you have to take on the chin. The important thing to do in times like these is communicate with your customers about what is going on and that you are doing everything you can to restore service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However Azure has some amazing features that you can configure to help manage when downtime occurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure is Microsoft’s global cloud platform. And it really is global, there are data centres in North Europe, West Europe, Brazil, Japan, two more in Asia and five in the US. In the event of problems it is highly unlikely that more than one of these would go down at once. If all of these are unavailable, I expect the planet earth is facing some kind of cataclysmic event and the fact that my website is down is not a priority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IC750592.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="IC750592" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IC750592.jpg?resize=662%2C347" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/a>
To take advantage of these multiple data centres, Azure has something called a Traffic Manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traffic Manager has various settings but I am using it in failover mode. This means that if one website goes down, the next one is used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All you need to do is create a traffic manager, add two or more websites to it (called endpoints) and choose a page that needs to be monitored so Azure knows which websites are up and which are down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are using SSL or custom domain names, there are a few extra steps you need to do. Your custom domain name needs pointing at the traffic manager, not the individual websites. The websites themselves have three domain names, the traffic manager address, the azure address and the custom domain name. The SSL certificate can then be assigned to each website that you have added to the traffic manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was easy wasn’t it, and now if a website goes down traffic manager will use the next one. While testing this, the transition to the next website was almost immediate. I did notice that if you had a browser showing the website open during a problem you sometimes got an error page, I think this was probably due to browser caching, reopening a tab or browser fixed this issue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tidying my desktop</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/tidying-my-desktop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/tidying-my-desktop/</guid><description>&lt;p>My desktop is always a mess. I constantly download files there and forget all about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every now and then I copy files into sub directories, so my desktop looks sane for a day or two before it gets out of control again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don’t I write a script that I can schedule to do this for me. Then my desktop will always be tidy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have written a few simple batch scripts, but of course the best scripting language out there at the moment is PowerShell. Lets use that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows provides a nice little utility for writing scripts called the Windows PowerShell ISE, so let&amp;rsquo;s start by loading that up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS has lots of help included to help you, just run &lt;strong>Get-Help [name of ps command]&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To move files you can use &lt;strong>Move-Item&lt;/strong> which works very similar to copy, specify source and destination. In my case I moved files based on their file extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Move-Item *.pdf folder&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all I need to do is schedule this script to run either every day or so, or maybe every time I login or switch my computer on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PowerShell can do lots more interesting things which hopefully I will blog about soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Source Code for Game of Life</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/source-code-for-game-of-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 09:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/source-code-for-game-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I blogged about the Game of Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well it took some searching through dead hard drives and old USB storage but I found the program I wrote, and better than that I have figured out how to turn it back into source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The file date is November 2004 and the source code has no comments so I don’t know what was going through my head when I wrote it, or even what some of it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To view the source code download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.src_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life.src&lt;/a>
, to download the finished program download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life&lt;/a>

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am actually surprised I was expected the code to be much worse than it was, I am not saying it is good, but I can see more than one method and I can’t see any code that obviously is repeated. I can see some terrible variable names. Note to future self don’t use tmp676_674!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming that I wrote this in 2004 what would I have been doing then? It was before I started working in IT. (Hard to imagine I know!) It may even have been before I started living with Keith, before he recruited me for my first IT role. I think I was probably working as an administrator for Defra at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we put 2004 in technical terms, it was before I joined facebook, Office 2003 and XP would have been installed on my PC, and probably felt brand new.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/about/</guid><description>&lt;img alt="Funky Si profile image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1922276.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; height: 150px" />
&lt;p>My real name is Simon Foster but my on-line persona is Funky Si a nickname I was given during my university days which has somehow stuck. I am a Developer working in the North of England. I have been working in IT departments since 2006 and have a wide range of experiences. More recently in the Software Development space but also SysAdmin, Server Infrastructure, Databases and DevOps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my spare time I have created &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/pwned-pass">Pwned Pass&lt;/a> a Xamarin Forms mobile app that makes use of the Have I Been Pwned? API to allow searching for breached emails and passwords. This is available from the Google Play store.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For more details about Have I been pwned? check out &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com">www.troyhunt.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pwned Pass is a simple Xamarin app that allows you to type in a password and tells you if it has been used in a data breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt of &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?&lt;/a> recently added a new API to his website which allows you to search his extensive database of pwned passwords, over 306 million of them. I have simply created a Android frontend to this API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be noted:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong>Do not send any password you actively use to a third-party service – even mine!&lt;/strong> I don’t log anything that you type into my app and this app makes use of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/">&lt;i>k&lt;/i>-anonymity&lt;/a> feature to avoid transmitting passwords.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As well as using Troy’s new API I also take advantage of his existing API’s. You can search his extensive database of email addresses to see if you have been affected by a data breach all from my android app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pwned Pass is now available from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords">Google Play Store&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
