&lt;p>The Oatmeal created a comic which you really should check out. It can be found &lt;a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/plane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The comic tells the story of a plane crash, in which the 25 year old co-pilot goes back into the burning plane to rescue passengers and lead a group of survivors through the desert to find help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The co-pilot was named Gene Roddenberry, and after these events he stopped being a pilot and became a writer and eventually created Star Trek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In these uncertain times when you are stranded in the desert, get out and help someone, it may change the world.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
