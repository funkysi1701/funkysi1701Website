The conference was free I just needed to arrange travel and accommodation. Microsoft have really looked after me and all the other guests, breakfast and lunch has been provided, I got a free t-shirt, coffee (or tea) all day plus a beer or glass of wine to end the day. And that’s before you collect any free stuff the vendors are giving away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first session was Designing resilient cloud applications with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeMillMatt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Soucoup&lt;/a>
and talked about some cloud technologies like Azure key vault and serving static files from blob storage. Unfortunately this had a few technical issues with the demos. I think it was just connectivity with the MongoDB backend but this slightly spoiled the session. As this was the only technical problem I noticed all day I can let it pass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next was a session on Azure DevOps mainly build and release pipelines called Deploying your application faster and safer with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bbenz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Benz&lt;/a>
. A lot of this I knew but good to reinforce I am doing things correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next was a session on Application Insights called Detecting application anomalies with Telemetry with Matt Soucoup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably the most useful session was on Docker and Kubernetes called Integrate containers and Kubernetes into your Azure DevOps build and release model with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/crad77" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco De Sanctis&lt;/a>
. Going to spend some time looking through the examples from this session.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A session on Serverless covered Azure Functions, Azure Logic apps and the other Azure Serverless offerings. Investing in Serverless: less servers, more code with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simona_cotin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simona Cotin&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly was a panel discussion on the changes facing IT Pros and SysAdmins. What is the future of the IT Pro in a DevOps &amp;amp; Cloudy world? with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jenstirrup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Stirrup&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bakionur" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baki Onur Okutucu&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmyKateNicho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Boyd&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheOpsMgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Thair&lt;/a>
. Should they learn to code, how should they make sure they keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow I have a loads more sessions, including ones about mental health, Azure pipelines, more Kubernetes stuff and dealing with failure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Surface Book Review</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/surface-book-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/surface-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/en-INTL-PDP0-Surface-Book-CR9-00001-P2.jpg?w=780&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

I have just bought myself a new laptop, but it is not just any laptop it is a &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msuk/en_GB/pdp/productID.332604800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Surface Book&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this is probably the first time I have bought myself a top of the range laptop and after a few days of use I am loving it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Surface Book is the latest in Microsoft’s Surface line of tablets but the first to feature a keyboard and be more like a traditional laptop. The keyboard is detachable from the keyboard so you can use the Surface Book like a tablet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it is a top of the range laptop, it was not cheap, so if price is a significant factor in your laptop choice this is not the machine for you. Microsoft are trying to compete with Apple’s Macbook range.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what did I get for my money:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Windows 10 Pro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>16Gb RAM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>512Gb SSD (Formatted Size nearer 474Gb)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6th Generation Intel Core i7 Processor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surface Pen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>13.5-inch touch screen&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I have only had the device for a few days but these are my thoughts so far. My primary reason for buying this is for doing development work with Visual Studio and SQL Server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really like the Surface Pen. This is a feature that I didn’t think I would use much. The Pen connects via bluetooth and allows interaction with the touch screen. The pressure sensitive screen allows all sort of touch actions to be performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I especially like the choice of keyboards that are offered when the physical keyboard is detached. You can have either a on screen keyboard which you can type with pen or fingers, an on screen keyboard that splits in half or you can write with the pen. This is an amazing feature. My handwriting is not good but most of the time it understands my scrawl. With this option you can hand write a tweet or fill in a form on a webpage. For speed I would not recommend this form of input for large amounts of text, but for browsing the web of when you are just clicking on links it is great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows Hello – I can unlock windows just by looking at my screen. How cool is that! It was really easy to setup, it just takes a photo of your face and next time you login all you need to do it look at the screen. Note if you are working in tablet mode, make sure the tablet is the correct way up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s not all brilliant though. Detaching the screen is fiddly and sometimes takes a few moments to do. A few times I have felt I needed another hand but I am sure the more I do this the easier I will find it to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Battery life isn’t great especially when running off the tablet only. This is due to the machine having two batteries, one in the base and one in the screen so with keyboard attached you have much longer use times. Actually I am finding the battery is lasting longer now that I have used it for a few days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The screen has a very high resolution 3000 x 2000 but using clever zooming technology everything is still readable and not tiny. However I use Remote Desktop a lot and this caused me a problem. When RDPing the remote session used the host screen resolution which made everything tiny on my servers. The solution to this can be found on &lt;a href="https://superuser.com/questions/891413/remote-connection-desktop-manager-2-7-does-not-support-dpi-scaling-anymore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperUser&lt;/a>
and involved using Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Connection Manager, a cool bit of software for managing multiple RDP sessions. This is actually an improvement on the way I usually work, but until I found the answer this was annoying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another minor annoyance with the keyboard is that you can’t press Ctrl-Alt-Del with one hand. Normally this isn’t a requirement but if the screen locks while I have my son on my lap I am stuck, but I won’t blame the surface book for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got my Surface Book I was also given a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. I am not a fan of this bit of tech as I can’t get it to work. I briefly got my old laptop to connect but my Surface Book keeps telling me NO!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall I like the Surface Book. It is certainly the nicest laptop I have ever used. Now that I have the docking station I can connect two monitors, have a wired internet connection and it becomes a proper work horse. What does everyone else think? Better than Apple’s range of laptops?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows 9 or do I mean 10</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/windows-9-or-do-i-mean-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/windows-9-or-do-i-mean-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Like many systems administrators I watched as the news came out yesterday about the latest version of windows. What would it be like? What would it be called? Would it be better or worse than previous versions?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was shocked when the name of the new operating system was revealed to be Windows 10. What really!? At first I though someone had tweeted a photoshopped image of the press conference, but no it was really going to be called Windows 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Windows 10" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/windows_10_fullwidth.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows 10 is the next operating system to be released after windows 8, many had been calling it windows 9 or windows Threshold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft has never had a fixed naming convention for its OSes, so should we really be that surprised at its new name.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Windows 1.0 (1985)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 2.0 (1987)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 3.0 (1990)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 95 (1995)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 98 (1998)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows ME (2000)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows XP (2001)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows Vista (2007)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 7 (2009)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 8 (2012)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 10 (2015)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Windows 11 (2021)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One reason Microsoft may have gone with with Windows 10 is because they wanted to signify that the coming Windows release would be the last “major” Windows update. What does it mean to be the last major update?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look at the list of OSes above you will see that between XP and Vista was a huge 6 years, this gap is/has caused a huge headache for IT professionals (me included). Software was written for XP because that is all that was available, when XP moved out of support earlier this year it caused loads as problems as people tried to get this software to work on more modern OSes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If windows 10 is around for a long time we may end up with a similar situation to XP, in that loads of software will run only on it and cause problems if you try and port it to whatever comes next. I am only a trainee developer so I don’t know what is involved with building an OS, but I would imagine there must be things that are very difficult or almost impossible to fix without ripping them out and starting again which is what happens when a new version of an OS is written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only time will tell if Windows 10 really is the last version of windows and what will happen to the OS in the future. What ever the case I am downloading a preview so I can have a look (I want my start menu back!)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
