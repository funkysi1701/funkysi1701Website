&lt;p>To start off you can view photos from the camera with the raspistill command. With a bit of clever scripting and the crontab I got the Pi taking pictures every 60 seconds. Even managed to take a nice picture of a robin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e21z7vbamy6w6akhhiwd.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However scripting isn&amp;rsquo;t really programming, and I would like to write a bit more code. Dotnet can run everywhere these days and it made sense to see if it would run on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@pete_codes has written a nice guide to getting started with dotnet on a Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/&lt;/a>
This guide and the nuget package &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/&lt;/a>
was all I needed to get started taking pictures with my Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial goal is to take some wildlife pictures, stick my camera to a window and take pictures of what flies/crawls/jumps past the window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code I have written so far is available on github &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the code takes a picture, uploads this file to Azure Blob Storage (so as not to fill up the Pi with too many image files) and deletes the image locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run a dotnet publish -c Release and then cron can run dotnet RaspberryPiDotNet.dll (with full paths to the relevant files)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use crontab to execute the code every 60 seconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My code has an appsetting.json file which has a couple of settings that need completing for my code to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storage: This is the connection string for Azure Blob Storage
LocalPath: This is the path to where the camera will save its photos to, something like /home/pi/ is all you need but feel free to specify what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the photos are in blob storage I plan to display them somewhere, add options to delete what I don&amp;rsquo;t want, maybe do something timelapsey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper release pipeline and this grates on me a bit. I have been doing a mixture of writing code in VS and pushing that to github and then doing git pull on the Pi, and also writing code directly on the Pi. (VS Code can connect via SSH which is pretty cool!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running Windows on Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/windows-10-raspberry-pi-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/windows-10-raspberry-pi-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year you may remember me talking about playing with a Raspberry Pi. Well since then my Raspberry Pi has been sat on a desk collecting dust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week I attended Leeds Sharp and the topic was &lt;strong>Running Windows on Raspberry Pi&lt;/strong> and this has inspired me again to do something with a Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But first what did I learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are a couple more of pics of last nights &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeedsSharp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LeedsSharp&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/QvlsYjNFvB">https://t.co/QvlsYjNFvB&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RaspberryPi?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RaspberryPi&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSIoT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MSIoT&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/60o4wiiPSv">pic.twitter.com/60o4wiiPSv&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Richard Tasker ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ (@ritasker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ritasker/status/725970415189909504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2016&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>I had heard that a cut down version of Windows 10 could be installed on the newer Raspberry Piâ€™s, but I hadnâ€™t really understood how cut down the version of windows is. Having now seen it demonstrated the OS consists of a single page with a few menu options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real power of Windows 10 IoT is when you connect remotely to it. There are a couple of ways to do this, PowerShell (check out &lt;a href="https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm&lt;/a>
for a few commands), and of course connecting Visual Studio to your Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I had previously played with a Pi, it had been with bash scripts and linux commands. The beauty of installing Windows IoT is that you can write c# code, something I do in my day job so theoretically I should find it easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The demonstration at Leeds Sharp was pretty impressive. If you are a fan of the Big Bang Theory you may recall Sheldon playing a Theremin. Well it is actually possible to construct a Theremin from a couple of sensors and a Raspberry Pi. The code for which is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritasker/IoTDemos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have been inspired what shall I do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Raspberry Pi wonâ€™t support Windows 10 IoT, so I need to buy the latest version. I am thinking of buying a kit so I can play about with a breadboard, LEDs and resistors. Maybe not build a robot straight away but certainly try doing something that connects to the GPIO pins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any suggestions leave a comment below.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
