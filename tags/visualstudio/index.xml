I will be honest when I first saw it, it was a mess. Here are a few of the things I did to try and regain control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was given access to the source code on Visual Studio Team Services. However this consisted of a single commit 3 months ago. When I looked at what was running on the production server it was clear that changes were being made live with no regard for source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I did was commit everything that was running live into source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I created a SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) project to keep track of all the database objects. Previously there was a folder with some stored procedures in it, but these did not match with what was currently running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sql-server-2012-management-studio-splash-screen.png?resize=300%2C204&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I now had in source control the current state of the website and the database, so I knew I could get things back to this state if I made some bad changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start by looking at the website code I had. There was no solution file, the only way to look at the website was to setup my local IIS to run what was in the website folder. I could then use Visual Studio to &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; my local IIS website and attach to process to debug it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I Looked at Default.aspx to see how the website worked. The majority of the website code was stored in the database stored procedures. After the tag there was a &amp;lt;% %&amp;gt; which contained a Response.Write(RunSP.RunStoredProcedure(Parameter1, Parameter2, &amp;hellip;) command, which executed a stored procedure and the results of the stored procedure was the html code including any javascript that the webpage needed to display. I will be honest I have never seen any code like it. My guess is that the developer was secretly a DBA and wanted to make any web page changes by just changing how the stored procedures work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This meant that the website is not going to do anything without a backup of the database running, and meant my SSDT project was going to be vital. However the database was in a bad state, it consisted of a fair few broken objects and SSDT would not build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using find I went through each of the broken database objects to find where in the code they were being used. Luckily most were referenced in commented out code, so I just removed all the broken database objects. The database could now be built. However there was a dependency on the users table of another database. (This was the developers solution to sharing logins between websites) As I was using SSDT I added a database dependency, problem solved for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I tried publishing my database. SQL CMD encountered a parsing error. The reason for this was my SPs contained javascript eg $(document), SQL CMD uses $(DatabaseName) as variables for different database so it was getting itself confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My solution was to use Find and Replace to replace all the $ with &amp;rsquo; + CHAR(36) + '&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I now have a SSDT project that builds and publishes but still no website project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get the website running from Visual Studio I started off creating a .Net 4 website project and added Entity Framework 5 and MVC 3 via nuget. I then copied all the website code into the new project, and with a bit of work I got it to build. Most of the work was relating to namespaces and referencing the correct one and moving the EF model from AppCode to a custom named folder. A bit of trial and error later I had a version of the website that could be run from Visual Studio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have not deployed my new version of the website as it needs further testing. No automated testing or even a smoke test checklist currently exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Visual-Studio-Team-Services.png?w=960&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As my source code is hosted on Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), I can get VSTS to build each commit and check I haven’t broken the build. This is not that helpful at the moment, hopefully one day I will have automated tests that can be run here as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow, I feel like I have done loads with this code so far but there is loads more still to do. I need to understand more about the business processes behind the code with a hope to understand why some architectural decisions have been made. I want to refactor the code as much as is possible, I would like to remove much of the html/javascript from the stored procedures as I can’t see that there is any advantage to running a website like this. Please correct my if I am wrong.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
