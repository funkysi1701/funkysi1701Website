This is my second certification exam I have sat after the Azure Fundamentals one I sat last year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This time was different than the Azure one. Colleagues at work encouraged me to look into doing this particular exam and my employer is going to cover the cost of the exam itself. Last time I did the exam in my own time and didn&amp;rsquo;t really discuss it with anyone from work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other difference was this time I went to a testing centre. The centre was a 5 minute walk from the office. So I decided to work from the office today and 20 minutes before the exam started I walked to the centre. I signed a couple of bits of paper, had my photo taken, had my passport and driving license laughed at, put my belongings in a locker and I was free to start the exam. No worrying about internet connectivity or kids making noise outside my room, or the endless photos at the prep stage of an exam from home. I think I prefer the exam centre experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other difference was the first exam was Azure, this one was AWS. Both exams cover similar concepts, they are both introductions to Cloud Computing. It&amp;rsquo;s ten months since I did the Azure one, however they both had multiple choice questions and gave you the results at the end. I feel overly familir with Azure, while I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that was with AWS yet. A lot of questions relied on you knowing what AWS services are called. eg AWS Pipeline, AWS CodeStar, AWS CodeBuild, Amazon CodeGuru are all AWS services and are easily mixed up, especially as I have only used a few AWS services, while I have used a lot more of the Azure ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My memory is the Azure gave you a breakdown of your score at the end, while I am still waiting for that from todays exam. This difference may of course be due to it being in a testing centre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still prefer Azure to AWS, however today has proven that I can learn AWS stuff as well. For my next exam I want to get more hands on with my learning, as most of the services I have learnt about so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in action.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really pleased with myself at achieving this. It was one of my goals for 2021 so I can tick that off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back in January I booked my first exam, however due to technical problems I didn&amp;rsquo;t get as far as the Exam. In order to be able to sit an exam like this you need a webcam and microphone so you can be monitored remotely to check that you are not cheating. Something in my network was blocking them from seeing my video so it got cancelled before it started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My theory is that either my internet connection was playing up at the time, My Pi Hole was blocking something, or something else on my network was blocking the video feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cancellation put me off Certifications, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to debug the issue and find out exactly what the problem was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months back I won a free Azure Certification for taking part in a skills challenge run by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregor_suttie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Suttie&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pixel_Robots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Hooper&lt;/a>
and this was due to expire at the end of this month so I thought why not book a second exam and see if I can get past the technical problems. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any exam prep as I thought, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get that far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time I connected directly to my router, bypassing most of the network, firewall and other items on my network that could possibly cause an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cleared my desk, took photos of my ID, took pictures of my desk from every orientation, and waited for the technical issues to start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was in a queue waiting for the exam to start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A connection issue has occurred you have been sent to the back of the queue. Oh here we go again!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But no I connected with the invigilator, who asked to confirm my monitors were disconnected and to move my wallet out of reach off my desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we are off, I am answering questions from the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about the questions, but I whizzed through them, most made me think, some I guessed at. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to pass, I thought maybe half marks or just under due to my familiarity with Azure. (I have been using it for years which must count for something!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was wrong I passed comfortably and now I have my first certification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My advice for you if you have been using Azure for a while is to book this exam and see how you do, you may well pass like me. There are plenty of opportunities to get a free exam, attending conferences like Ignite often qualify you for one, look out for challenges and competitions by #AzureFamily people on twitter as they are very encouraging and helpful in your Certification journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes I am thinking about what Certificate to do next!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
