&lt;p>Scratch is a website that allows you to &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; by combining blocks together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how the scratch website describes its self&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Scratch is the world’s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.
Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.
Scratch is always free and is available in more than 70 languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Scratch can be found by going to &lt;a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of the blocks affect your character or &amp;ldquo;sprite&amp;rdquo;, the default is a cute looking cat which may also be the scratch logo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/scratch.png" loading="lazy"
width="905" height="835"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The left hand side of the screen consists of a list of the blocks of code you can use and your coding area where you can arrange them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The right hand side shows the results of your code, where you can run and test what your code does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It didn&amp;rsquo;t take my boy long to code something like this tonight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/scratch2.png" loading="lazy"
width="712" height="725"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This game moves the &amp;ldquo;sprite&amp;rdquo; towards the mouse pointer and a message &amp;ldquo;got you&amp;rdquo; appears on screen when it reaches your mouse pointer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go through all the different blocks you can choose from, but I will highlight some of the programming concepts being learnt here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>inputs&lt;/strong> every computer program needs inputs and there are lots to choose from, things like moving the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>outputs&lt;/strong> your code needs to do something, this code moves a sprite about the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>variables&lt;/strong> my boy hasn&amp;rsquo;t heard of algebra yet, but he is already grasping concepts like variables, where a value can be assigned and maths can be applied to. In this example the score increases&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>loops&lt;/strong> this program keeps looping until it reaches the mouse pointer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>logic&lt;/strong> other logic commands are also available, like if / else statements, also &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; and = statements can be used&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of help and tutorials on the site to help you along, and you can customise the look and even record short sound clips to play in your code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Back to BASIC</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/back-to-basic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/back-to-basic/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">How exciting my Lynx Computer from my childhood has come home, all 96k of it &lt;a href="https://t.co/aeN38KBiS8">pic.twitter.com/aeN38KBiS8&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Simon Foster (@funkysi1701) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/funkysi1701/status/1475139125154037760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2021&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the syntax for BASIC, luckily I have been able to find the &lt;a href="http://elborg.dk/books.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manual&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the commands are listed inside so lets see what we can do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx presents you with a command prompt in which you can type text. Back in the 80s we had a tape player to load programs from tape, however I don&amp;rsquo;t have one today so only programs I write can be run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRINT - To write Hello World, you can just type PRINT &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; and Hello World appears on the screen. To Write a program that displays Hello World, you just write the line number first.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 PRINT &amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run this you type RUN
To view the code you type LIST&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Edit a specific Line you can use Ctrl+E and type the line number, or you can just write the line out again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CLS - This command clears the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INPUT N - stores text typed by the user and stores it in the variable N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GOTO N - Execution of code continues at Line Number N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Program I wrote with a bit of help from my boys.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 CLS
20 PRINT &amp;#34;What is your Age?&amp;#34;
30 INPUT N
40 IF N&amp;gt;5 AND N&amp;lt;41 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a good age&amp;#34;
50 ELSE IF N&amp;lt;6 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a spaceman&amp;#34;
60 ELSE IF N&amp;gt;40 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>My 4yo didn&amp;rsquo;t like being &amp;ldquo;too young&amp;rdquo; in the original version, so my 6yo helped me change him to be a &amp;ldquo;spaceman&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not bad and it was fun pair programming with a 6yo, all my typos were quickly spotted, and he easily understood the logic of IF/ELSE/THEN statements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx comes from 1983 and has just 96k of memory. I am very lucky it actually still works, however I have been able to find an emulator so I can write Lynx BASIC from the comfort of my laptop. &lt;a href="https://jynxemulator.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jynxemulator&lt;/a>
, it is also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonathan-markland/Jynx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the ROMs so getting from the website is a better option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The developer experience today is so much nicer than it must have been in the 1980s, however back then distractions must have been much reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No internet or google to get answers to your questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Copy/Paste of text&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Load/Save (unless you have a working disk drive or tape player!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No IDE&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Build or Release process just type RUN&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DotNet on a Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have had a Raspberry Pi for a few years and recently I connected it up again, I plugged in the camera and everything worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start off you can view photos from the camera with the raspistill command. With a bit of clever scripting and the crontab I got the Pi taking pictures every 60 seconds. Even managed to take a nice picture of a robin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e21z7vbamy6w6akhhiwd.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However scripting isn&amp;rsquo;t really programming, and I would like to write a bit more code. Dotnet can run everywhere these days and it made sense to see if it would run on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@pete_codes has written a nice guide to getting started with dotnet on a Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/&lt;/a>
This guide and the nuget package &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/&lt;/a>
was all I needed to get started taking pictures with my Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial goal is to take some wildlife pictures, stick my camera to a window and take pictures of what flies/crawls/jumps past the window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code I have written so far is available on github &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the code takes a picture, uploads this file to Azure Blob Storage (so as not to fill up the Pi with too many image files) and deletes the image locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run a dotnet publish -c Release and then cron can run dotnet RaspberryPiDotNet.dll (with full paths to the relevant files)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use crontab to execute the code every 60 seconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My code has an appsetting.json file which has a couple of settings that need completing for my code to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storage: This is the connection string for Azure Blob Storage
LocalPath: This is the path to where the camera will save its photos to, something like /home/pi/ is all you need but feel free to specify what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the photos are in blob storage I plan to display them somewhere, add options to delete what I don&amp;rsquo;t want, maybe do something timelapsey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper release pipeline and this grates on me a bit. I have been doing a mixture of writing code in VS and pushing that to github and then doing git pull on the Pi, and also writing code directly on the Pi. (VS Code can connect via SSH which is pretty cool!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Technology I want to learn more about</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/technology-i-want-to-learn-more-about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/technology-i-want-to-learn-more-about/</guid><description>&lt;p>While at &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2019/02/26/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-london">Microsoft Ignite&lt;/a>
I heard about a lot of cool tech that I want to know more about. The best way to learn something is use it to solve a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what can I build that is both useful and will let me play with some new tech?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a Xamarin Forms app &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/pwned-pass/">Pwned Pass&lt;/a>
that has over 500 downloads on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google play&lt;/a>
and over 80 downloads on the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/pwned-pass/9nm2whnztnlt?rtc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store&lt;/a>
. This has given me a small user base that I can use to make use of whatever I build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My app makes use of the &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIBP API&lt;/a>
created by Troy Hunt. I am going to build my own API, initially it will just make calls to the HIBP API. Building this will give me experience of building something with .net Core from design to deployment. I have made a start already on doing this, I have an empty .net core API project which deploys to an Azure web app using the build and release pipelines from Azure DevOps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may be wondering why I am not making use of Azure Functions to build this API. Azure functions is certainly a great technology that is worth learning about. However I have done a little bit with them in the past and I don’t believe I would be able to learn all the things I want to if I used Azure Functions. My primary goal is learning and sharing that learning via this blog. It may well be I move to using Azure Functions later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another tech I am keen to learn more about is &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/key-vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Key Vault&lt;/a>
. This is a technology that allows the securing of keys, connection strings and certificates. I want my app to securely get keys and security information without any of it having to be committed to source code or shared insecurely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monitoring my app is also a key learning from me. I use application insights already, but I would like to extend my understanding of this so telemetry can be fed back into the build and bad deployments stopped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is my complete list of learning and tech I want to touch on. It is a long list and I imagine it will get longer as I work through it. I want to regularly blog and share what I have been working on. I currently have a working build and release pipeline but nothing of note to build or release. I know Key Vault needs looking at early as the identity of the website in Azure is key to getting that tech working correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Build API with .net core&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add build and release pipeline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make use of Azure KeyVault for secrets, connection strings etc&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plugin My Xamarin app to make use of it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor my API with Application Insights&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secure it with CSPs and log this into &lt;a href="https://report-uri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report URI&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consider building a web frontend to my API using a javascript library or framework. Maybe react but this can be decided later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dockerize the API and add the creation of docker images to the build/release pipeline&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Microsoft Ignite | The Tour – London</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-london/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-london/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have just spent the first day at the conference Microsoft Ignite | The Tour.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/D0UTj08XgAEo1YJ.jpg?fit=662%2C440&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
The conference was free I just needed to arrange travel and accommodation. Microsoft have really looked after me and all the other guests, breakfast and lunch has been provided, I got a free t-shirt, coffee (or tea) all day plus a beer or glass of wine to end the day. And that’s before you collect any free stuff the vendors are giving away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first session was Designing resilient cloud applications with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeMillMatt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Soucoup&lt;/a>
and talked about some cloud technologies like Azure key vault and serving static files from blob storage. Unfortunately this had a few technical issues with the demos. I think it was just connectivity with the MongoDB backend but this slightly spoiled the session. As this was the only technical problem I noticed all day I can let it pass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next was a session on Azure DevOps mainly build and release pipelines called Deploying your application faster and safer with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bbenz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Benz&lt;/a>
. A lot of this I knew but good to reinforce I am doing things correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next was a session on Application Insights called Detecting application anomalies with Telemetry with Matt Soucoup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably the most useful session was on Docker and Kubernetes called Integrate containers and Kubernetes into your Azure DevOps build and release model with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/crad77" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco De Sanctis&lt;/a>
. Going to spend some time looking through the examples from this session.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A session on Serverless covered Azure Functions, Azure Logic apps and the other Azure Serverless offerings. Investing in Serverless: less servers, more code with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simona_cotin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simona Cotin&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly was a panel discussion on the changes facing IT Pros and SysAdmins. What is the future of the IT Pro in a DevOps &amp;amp; Cloudy world? with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jenstirrup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Stirrup&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bakionur" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baki Onur Okutucu&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmyKateNicho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Boyd&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheOpsMgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Thair&lt;/a>
. Should they learn to code, how should they make sure they keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow I have a loads more sessions, including ones about mental health, Azure pipelines, more Kubernetes stuff and dealing with failure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yaml Builds on Azure DevOps</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/yaml-builds-on-azure-devops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/yaml-builds-on-azure-devops/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been using Azure DevOps (Or VSTS or VSO etc) for a while now and one of the great features is doing automatic builds with every check-in. This is more commonly known as a CI (continuous integration) build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More recently I have started playing about with creating my build using YAML files instead of using the web user interface to create my build.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#why">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You may wonder why go to the effort of learning the YAML syntax when you can just create the build in Azure DevOps and then forget about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly it is because the build changes over time and you shouldn’t just forget about it. If something changes over time then you might want to version control it, or look at a previous version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets say you create a pull request that replaces a .net 4.7 web service with a .net core web service. If you have a CI build this PR will fail because it won’t build. If you change the build first any other builds going on will fail. What you want in this case is the build to be associated with that branch or PR. Any builds before you merge this change in will continue to work and any after this change will also work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do you get started with YAML builds? Well the first thing is to make sure that YAML builds are turned on, as I write this I believe they are still a feature you can turn on or off. Have a look in Preview features and make sure they are turned on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next look at any of your existing builds and click the View YAML link. This will show you an example YAML file of your existing build. You could just save this as azure-pipelines.yml and checkin to the root of your project. You can also click the add new build pipeline option, this will give you some templates to start you off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The YAML file consists of a series of build steps usually called tasks, with a few settings before to configure things like parameters or build agents. Detailed docs about the syntax of the file can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&amp;amp;tabs=schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For my mobile app my YAML files consist of downloading nuget packages, building the solution, building specific projects with desired settings, running powershell or other scripts to set things up and finally publishing the results of the build as artifacts so that they can be used in any releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="secure-it">Secure It!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#secure-it">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Avoid committing passwords and secure keys into source control. I have found you can upload secure files via Azure DevOps and then add a download secure files step at the start of your build. This allows the secure file to be used during the build but the contents of the file can’t be viewed by anyone with access to the source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find it often takes a bit of thinking about how to achieve this, but it is usually possible to keep keys and secrets secure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back at 2018</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/looking-back-at-2018/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/looking-back-at-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>As 2018 starts to draw to a close let’s look at some of the highlights from the past year.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>New Home - I started 2018 with the goal of buying my own home and I managed it. At the end of October I actually moved in but it was months of looking at houses, speaking to estate agents, saving, packing and unpacking. There is more I want to do to my home in 2019 so this is only really the beginning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New Job - Another goal was to kick my career up a notch and this happened in June. It has been great working as part of a large team and I have learnt loads, there is much more I want to learn and contribute to so 2019 should be great on that front.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New Car - Not a goal that I achieved as unfortunately in October I was involved in a car accident, no one was seriously hurt but this was a horrible experience to go through. My car was written off which gave me an excuse to buy a new car.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>See more of family was a goal, I am not sure if I really achieved this. However family have been around loads for us during our move and we do live closer so hopefully I can work on this some more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Celebrate 5 years of marriage. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been an easy year for me and the wife due to moving house and all the stress that involved plus with two children she was diagnosed with Postnatal Depression which as a family we are still dealing with. All that said we had a fab weekend away and we so need to do something similar again soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family. 2018 has included many great times with my two boys. It&amp;rsquo;s been amazing seeing them grow, in September we had a thanksgiving service for them and in July we had our annual holiday.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lightning Talk. This is the only thing I mentioned as a goal that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen, it&amp;rsquo;s on my 2019 list so hopefully I can kick myself into action but with everything else I achieved something had to slip.   &lt;/li>

&lt;p>My development environment has typically required installing SQL Server. SQL is a bit of a beast with lots of options and takes time to setup how you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However since Microsoft have now created a version of SQL Server that runs on Linux you can run SQL Server in a Linux container with only a few commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to assume you already have Docker for windows installed on your development machine. If not head over to &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#where-to-go-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker&lt;/a>
and find out how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Microsoft guide to setting up SQL Server in a Linux container can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need to download the image. In a powershell window run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This downloads the latest sql server image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To run this image run the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1433:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run a SQL Server image you are required to accept the terms and conditions and set a default sa password. These are added as environment variables with the -e flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also need to set the ports that your container will run on (1433 is the default SQL port) and give your container a name, in this case &amp;ldquo;sql&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have already installed SQL Server you will not be able to run the container on the same port as your local install. To solve this you can select a different port.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1434:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>-p 1434:1433 maps the 1433 port on the container to port 1434 of your local environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have run this command you can connect SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to (local) or (local),1434 if you are using a different port using the credentials you provided and execute any SQL you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your development environment requires windows authentication this of course is not for you, if it doesn’t you are good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The development environment I have been using has various powershell scripts for setting things up. These assume windows auth. However I have adapted them to take custom credentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$credential = Get-Credential $server.ConnectionContext.LoginSecure=$false
$server.ConnectionContext.set_Login($credential.UserName)
$server.ConnectionContext.set_SecurePassword($credential.Password)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The Get-Credential command creates a dialog where you can enter SQL credentials, this is then stored in a variable and used in the rest of the script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do I restore a backup file to my container?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker exec -it sql mkdir /var/opt/mssql/backup
docker cp database.bak sql:/var/opt/mssql/backup
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This creates a backup folder and copies a backup file from your local environment to the container. You can then use management studio to restore the backup file (or you could write a sql script to do it). One thing to note when restoring databases, make sure the files are restored to Linux locations not windows locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only issues I have encountered so far are the lack of support for SSIS packages and no windows auth. There are sql server windows images available which I haven’t tried yet which may work better with some of these options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2018 The Story So far</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/2018-the-story-so-far/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/2018-the-story-so-far/</guid><description>&lt;p>Remember me? I used to write blog posts but somehow life got in the way. So much has happened this year, lets have a look at my &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2018/lets-see-what-2018-can-do">goals&lt;/a>
for 2018 and see how far we have got with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buy-a-house">Buy a house&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#buy-a-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My first goal for 2018 was to buy a house. Well so much progress has been made with this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We looked at a few houses, and have made an offer, had it accepted and are waiting for the last few things to get arranged before we start arranging to move in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The location we decided upon was &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Thorne,&amp;#43;Doncaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thorne&lt;/a>
. This is about an hour from York where most of our friends are and my wife has lived all her life, and also an hour from where my family live. I have tried my best to balance location and size of property and we think our new home is going to be a good balance but only time will tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a bit of a mammoth time ahead of me getting everything we own packed up and moved to our new home so wish me luck, but we will get there it is just going to be hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-job">New Job&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#new-job">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In June 2018 I started a new job. This was slightly later than I had hoped but I believe it has been worth the wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new job has lots of perks. Finish early on a Friday (1pm), On site canteen, Cool air-conditioned office, Flexible working hours, Part of a big development team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main benefit is that I am part of a big development team. I have a huge list of things to learn both in terms of technology and how large development teams function. The team is about to finish the first sprint that I have contributed to. My contributions have been very small. A bug fix here, a tweak of an API there. But the important thing is that I am making a contribution and learning along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have also started asking questions about deployment and how this could be automated. Something that interests me, especially with the sysadmin and devops background. I have been tasked with learning &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker&lt;/a>
, so expect some blog posts on this topic in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="see-more-of-family">See more of family&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#see-more-of-family">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This one I am going to count as a miss. I have seen family a few times this year, but my efforts have been more on the first two items in this list. Hopefully this will change as things settle down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">Celebrate 5 years of Marriage&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Me and the wife had a great weekend away to celebrate our wedding anniversary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-my-two-children">Celebrate my two children&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-my-two-children">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not happened yet but it is booked and we just need to arrange a few more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have made no effort to do a talk and this is going to be a goal for 2019 I think. Most of the reason is concentrating on the other areas above, but also because I am not a natural speaker and I don’t like stepping out of my comfort zone. But I will do it, I just need to wait for other things to calm down a bit first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="family-holiday">Family Holiday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#family-holiday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We had a great week away at the start of July. The weather was really great (and still is) and we had lots of time doing things as a family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Casting and Converting between types</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/casting-and-converting-between-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/casting-and-converting-between-types/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I was asked how to convert a number to a string. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few ways of approaching this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most objects in c# have a method called ToString() which displays the string representation of that object. This is because of inheritance, all objects inherit from System.Object which defines ToString().&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Int32 is a struct so it inherits from System.ValueType which also inherits from System.Object&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so in code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> a = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">9&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> b = a.ToString();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the reverse. However the reverse runs the risk of throwing an error, let&amp;rsquo;s look at why.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> b = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;9&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> c = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> d = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;two&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>All are valid strings but only one can be converted to a number. Use the TryParse method to convert to a number.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span>.TryParse(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;9&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">out&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> e);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>TryParse will not throw an exception if the conversion fails, if it succeeds variable e will contain the result. Note an earlier version of c# required you to define the out parameter before using it with TryParse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>int.Parse exists to do the same thing however it will throw exceptions if a conversion is not possible. The same is true if you use Convert.ToInt32(&amp;ldquo;two&amp;rdquo;);&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="casting">Casting&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#casting">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Casting is a way to explicitly telling the compiler that a type is actually another type and you are aware data loss will occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">double&lt;/span> x = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4.5&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> y = (&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span>)x;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However it is not possible to cast a string to a number format as a string can contain any character not just number characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Let’s Encrypt is awesome</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-encrypt-is-awesome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-encrypt-is-awesome/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s Encrypt is a free way to get a SSL certificate onto your website and until recently I had never tried it. It is very easy and I think it is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IIS is the web server software the Microsoft include with Windows 10 and Windows Server. I have it installed on my laptop and it displays the default IIS page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iis.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not really a good idea to host websites on your laptop, use a dedicated web server, or host with a hosting company, however the techniques are the same and it gives me something to write about!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to point a domain name at what IIS on my machine was serving up I did the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do a google search for “whats my IP”, this will return your public IP. Most residential ISPs use dynamic IPs so it may change over time, (which is another reason not to host a website on your laptop!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add an A record on a domain with the IP address you have just got&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your public IP most likely points at your router not your laptop so enable port forwarding of port 80 and port 443 to the internal IP of your laptop (something like 192.168.0.11 etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now comes the fun Let’s Encrypt stuff!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need a Let’s Encrypt client, there are a lot of them out there mostly for linux flavours, however a bit of googling found a windows one. Go to &lt;a href="https://github.com/PKISharp/win-acme/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/PKISharp/win-acme/releases&lt;/a>
and download the zip file and unzip it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run the executable from the zip file and follow the onscreen prompts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/letsencrypt.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Press N to create a new certificate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then press 1 to bind to single website found in your IIS setup&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/letsencrypt2.jpg?resize=768%2C686&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now magically Let’s Encrypt knows what you have setup in IIS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all you need to do is enter an email address incase a renewal fails and agree to the let’s encrypt terms and you are all setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/letsencrypt3.jpg?resize=768%2C920&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How awesome and easy is that for getting your websites working with a SSL certificate. If you have IIS configured on a server, give it a try and you can SSL all your things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DNS for Developers</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/dns-for-developers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/dns-for-developers/</guid><description>&lt;p>DNS is the backbone of the internet and as such I believe every developer should know something about the basics and not just leave it for the sysadmin to sort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-dns">What is DNS?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-is-dns">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>DNS or Domain Name System is what translates Domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wait-what-is-an-ip-address-and-what-are-domain-names">Wait what is an IP address and what are domain names?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#wait-what-is-an-ip-address-and-what-are-domain-names">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You do realise this is a developer blog? An IP address is a unique address on the internet and a domain name is a user friendly label for one or more of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example might be google.com which for me resolves to 216.58.204.14&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-it-works">How it works&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-it-works">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dns-rev-1.gif?resize=360%2C320&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
When your browser makes a request to google.com it makes a request to your ISPs DNS Servers. This resolves google.com to 216.58.204.14&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In more detail your ISPs DNS server will forward the DNS query to another DNS server and will cache the results for a set amount of time. This is the TTL or Time To Live. Next time the ISP DNS Server will be able to reply directly without needing to forward requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This forwarding and caching is what makes making a DNS change not instantaneous. The TTL needs to be reached so that no results are still being fetched from the cache of DNS servers across the globe.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dns-records">DNS Records&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#dns-records">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now we know roughly how DNS works let’s look at the most common type of records&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#a">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A (Host) records are the most simple records which translate domain names to IPs&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eg &lt;a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.google.com&lt;/a>
to 216.58.204.14&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="cname">CNAME&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#cname">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is different to an A record in that it maps a domain name to another domain name when no A record exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eg &lt;a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.google.com&lt;/a>
to somethingelse.google.com&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically Azure makes use of CNAMEs for many of its services especially adding a custom domain name&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="mx">MX&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#mx">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>MX stands for Mail Exchange and is used for configuring email&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="name-server">Name Server&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#name-server">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Every domain has a number of Name Servers which tells you what servers control the DNS settings for that domain. If you change your Name Servers then the new Name servers will be where you can change your DNS settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to use a service like &lt;a href="https://dnsimple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNSimple&lt;/a>
instead of &lt;a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">123reg&lt;/a>
or where ever you registered your domain then all you need to do is change your Name servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="aaaa">AAAA&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#aaaa">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Like A record but for ipv6&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-next">What next?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-next">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Want to put some different DNS records into practise? Buy a domain name and publish some content to it. Check out my previous post about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/creating-dns-records-programmatically">programmatically adding records&lt;/a>
. Want an SSL certificate? Get a wildcard one and then you can apply it to any subdomain you add to your domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a new website you want to publish consider which of the following is better:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com/newsite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.example.com/newsite&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://newsite.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://newsite.example.com&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I much prefer the second option, it looks cleaner, there is no potential conflict with the parent site, no subfolder issues between production and development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code Reviews</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/codereviews/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/codereviews/</guid><description>&lt;p>Reviewing code is a great habit to get into. Code reviews help share knowledge between your team members and help catch bugs before they get into production. But how do you get into the habit of reviewing and avoid the we don’t have time to do this mentality?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) has some great options that can help make code reviews second nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#pull-requests">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of source control systems have the concept of pull requests. This is where you request others to review your code usually in a branch and if they approve it, merge it into a main branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create a pull request in VSTS go to the Code section and select Pull Requests. Often VSTS will make a suggestion of what branch to make a pull request for, if you don’t see this just click the New Pull request button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select a branch you want to merge from and a branch that should be merged into (usually you merge into master from a feature branch). Give your pull request a title and description and select who should review your code, this can either be an individual or a group of people. You can also review all the changes that will be reviewed so you can make any last minute changes before it is reviewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you are anything like me you want your code merged in as soon as you have created your pull request and there is nothing stopping you reviewing your own code and clicking approve and merge on your own pull request. However &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/git/branch-policies?view=vsts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branch policies&lt;/a>
is a way around this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="branch-policies">Branch Policies&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#branch-policies">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Branch Policy" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/save-policy-changes.png?resize=599%2C901&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Branch policies allow you to specify how your code gets merged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to the list of branches in VSTS and select branch policy and you will see a whole host of options to customise the merge process. If you do this on the master branch you will not be able to commit any changes to master without it going through a pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first option enables you to select how many reviewers are needed on your code. If no one else works on your project best not setting this, but for everyone else setting at least one person to review your code is a great practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next you can ensure that your pull request is linked to a work item, this helps keep ensure you are actually fixing issues and not just making change for the sake of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check for comment resolution is a good setting to enable. This ensures that if your reviewer has commented about you needing to change this line here, it ensures that you do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enforce merge strategy allows you to choose between fast forward merge or squash merge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Build validation enables the code to be built using a build definition you have configured. This is a great way to check code builds or tests pass before it gets merged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last two options allow you to specify code reviewers and third party external services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Android Development Options</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/android-development-options/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/android-development-options/</guid><description>&lt;p>A friend asked me how to get started in Android Development and I thought I might have a go at answering that question here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am by no means an expert in Android development, I do have an app in the play store so I know something.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="manifest-file">Manifest File&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#manifest-file">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is probably the easiest option and also doesn’t actually create an android app so I am not sure if it should be included in this list of not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a website and you want to create an app for that you could just create a manifest file and add this to your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once your website has a manifest file, if you visit your website using a mobile phone or tablet you will get the option to add a shortcut to the home screen. You then have an app like experience in that you can click an icon to launch your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A manifest file is a simple text file which specifies a few settings like the icon size, filename, what page loads when clicked and name of your “app”&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="visual-studio">Visual Studio&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#visual-studio">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is the option I know most about as is what I have used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are familiar with Visual Studio you can use the Xamarin Forms software to create your app in C#. Xamarin Forms allows you to easily create cross platform apps that run on Android, IOS and windows phone. So far I have only experimented with Android but it should be relatively easy to extend my code to run on other platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xamarin Forms allows you to write one a single codebase that can be compiled to run on the different platforms. Xamarin requires the use of XAML a XML like markup language for designing UI elements.&lt;/p>

, &lt;a href="https://www.xamarin.com/forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xamarin Forms&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="android-studio">Android Studio&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#android-studio">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I don’t know much about this option so do correct me if I don’t get the details correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Android Studio can be downloaded from Google this allows you to create java code to run directly on an android device. From what I know this is fairly similar experience to Visual Studio but instead of writing your code in C# you use Android Studio and write it directly in java.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="cordova">Cordova&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#cordova">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Cordova allows you to use HTML, CSS and javascript to create cross platform apps. I have no idea why I haven’t heard of this technology until today as it sounds very flexible especially if you know a little bit of javascript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More information&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize there are lots of different options available to create an android app. What you choose depends on what you want to build, what language and experience you have and if your app needs to be cross platform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tips for Developing Yourself</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/tips-for-developing-yourself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/tips-for-developing-yourself/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while I have been mentoring a friend and I thought I might share some top tips I have implemented in my career so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="hard-work">Hard Work&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#hard-work">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>At school I was told: “&lt;em>Only in the dictionary does Success come before Work&lt;/em>“. Yes it is a bit of a corny saying however it has stuck in my head and it’s true. If you want to get anywhere you need to work at it. For many years I just drifted along, but as soon as I knuckled down and worked hard my career started going somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="write-a-blog">Write a Blog&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#write-a-blog">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Writing is an important skill that you need to work at to improve. If you commit to writing one blog post a week this will help to improve this skill. Even after 150+ blog posts I still feel I need to improve. Not only that it will also help others learn something from you and shows a willingness to contribute to the community. If a Hiring Manager reads your blog he can see some of the stuff you know or care about and may help give you the edge over more experienced candidates.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#soft-skills">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>This is one I need to work on but you should concentrate on the so called “&lt;em>Soft Skills&lt;/em>“. Soft Skills are the skills you have for dealing with others. Are you good at talking to people? Or good at getting requirements out of business owners? If so you have some soft skills, don’t underestimate the value that these bring to a team and keep developing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="build-a-side-project">Build a Side Project&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#build-a-side-project">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Start building a side project, it doesn’t matter what it is but start building something. I started building a Xamarin app but I have learnt loads of other connected things while doing this, ViewModels, APIs, Build and Deployment processes, Azure Functions. It also gives you ammunition for things to blog about. If you are short of ideas try solving a problem or rebuild something you use.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="use-your-spare-time">Use your spare time&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#use-your-spare-time">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>During the day there are moments you can reclaim for learning stuff. There are lots of &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/podcasts">podcast&lt;/a>
which discuss useful development topics, listen to these while driving to work. Subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/pluralsight">pluralsight&lt;/a>
and listen to this while washing up. Don’t get too concerned with learning everything, however think how much more you are learning than not listening at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="im-not-ready">I’m not ready!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#im-not-ready">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>We are never ready to take that next step, it is so easy to make excuses like I need to learn x, or know y. The only way to know if you are ready is to try and to keep trying. Iterate as you go so you keep improving yourself. If you wait before you start trying you will end up waiting forever. If you start trying now you will make some small progress and have a better idea of what you need to do to achieve your goals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New version of Pwned Pass</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/new-version-pwned-pass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/new-version-pwned-pass/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Pwned Pass" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qZTLiWRfQwS7pT6gExLMTvU1pl8NtTU-kbeoSzD68p1D-EPY3Pg7cz2AN66QJpTTp1c=h900-rw" loading="lazy"
/>
A new version of Pwned Pass is available from &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troy Hunt&lt;/a>
released V2 of Pwned Pass onto his &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haveibeenpwned&lt;/a>
website. There are now over half a billion passwords that have appeared in data breaches for you to search.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time Troy has included information about how many times a password has appeared in his data. So “password” returns a value of 3,303,003 so is a really, really bad choice of password to use. However the password “windows 10” has only appeared twice so is much better, however I would still recommend avoiding using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the great things about the internet is that on the day of release I was tweeting Troy so I could get my android app updated to take advantage of these new features. I even helped him identify an issue with the documentation on his site. He has also kindly add a link to my app onto his website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That conversation and link has lead to a massive increase in app downloads. Before I was going steady on about 14 installs, now I have 86 active installs. I am not sure if this will increase anymore but if you are reading this because you downloaded my app, then thank you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My app has four main features:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Password Check – this allows you to search a password and see if it has appeared in a data breach and also the number of times that password has appeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Email Check – this allows you to search your email address and see which data breach it has been involved in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>List of Data Breaches – this lists the data breaches from haveibeenpwned.com you can also sort by Date Added, Number of accounts and name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calendar of Breaches – this shows a github like chart of what days breaches are added&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you like my app do let me know. I have received a few ratings on google play it would be great to get a few more. If you want me to add a feature or have ideas of how I could improve it let me know as well.&lt;/p>

By huge I mean 77 if statements one after the other, each if checks to see what page id you are on and loads different content. This is not easy to maintain and I want to refactor it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One option would be to replace the if statements with a switch block. However this is just as unmanageable as the huge if block. Lets look at a better option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Polymorphism&lt;/strong> is where you create a base class and then create sub classes from it. In my case I created an interface IPage with a single method CreateContent.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">interface&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">IPage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> CreatePageContent();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and then create 77 classes for each page which implemented this single method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now comes the fun bit how do I call the correct page class from my original code?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a dictionary than maps page ids to the class names.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> Dictionary&amp;lt;PageIds, Type&amp;gt; PageIdToClass = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Dictionary&amp;lt;PageIds, Type&amp;gt;()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> PageIds.HomePage,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(HomePage)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> },
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> PageIds.ContactPage,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(ContactPage)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> },
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc &lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is the one step I am not 100% happy with as I think it may be possible to remove or simplify this step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I have a way to map ids to classes I can write a class to do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">MyPage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> IPage &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> MyPage(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> pageId)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> PageIds p = (PageIds)pageId;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Type t = PageIdToClass[p];
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> ConstructorInfo constructor = t.GetConstructor(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Type[] { });
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = (IPage)constructor.Invoke(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Create()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo.CreatePageContent();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So in my constructor I take the pageId and pass it to my dictionary to get which subclass to load. I then get its Constructor and invoke it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I can remove the huge if block and replace it with a single line of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> page = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> MyPage(pageId);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>On the face of it this change might look like a lot of work for not much gain as we started off with one file and now we have the original file, an interface, 77 subclasses and the MyPage class. However the original file is a lot more manageable and each sub class can be altered independently of each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a big step towards making this code more maintainable, there is always more that can be done but that can wait for another day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chrome distrusts SSL Certificates</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/ssl-distrusts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/ssl-distrusts/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the websites I have been working on has been displaying an error in the console. The error reads as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>The SSL certificate used to load resources from https://example.com will be distrusted in M70. Once distrusted, users will be prevented from loading these resources. See https://g.co/chrome/symantecpkicerts for more information.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>But what does this mean? Well let’s start by looking at the &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/chromes-plan-to-distrust-symantec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link&lt;/a>
provided.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In January 2017 it was revealed that Certificate Authorities run by Symantec which include Thawte, VeriSign, Equifax, GeoTrust, and RapidSSL had been issuing certificates that did not comply with baseline standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting with Chrome 66, Google has decided to remove trust for these certificates. Chrome 66 is due for release around 17th April. My error mentions M70 so what does that refer to?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chrome 70 which is due to be released in October 2018 will removed the trust for another batch of Symantec certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are getting one of these errors because you are using a certificate that is going to be distrusted what will your site look like in Chrome 66 or Chrome 70?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well Chrome 66 is now in the dev channel so we can give it a try. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tempsnip.png.jpg?resize=662%2C443&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not very nice for your users is it? Now is the time to order a new SSL certificate to avoid this happening to your site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first saw this error a few months ago and have been reading up about it and waiting for Chrome 66 to reach the dev channel so I could test what it did to my site. However now that I have Chrome 66 installed I spotted the intranet for the company I work for is also affected. I do not directly work on the intranet so I notified the security team that they may want to look into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately the response I received has been that Google needs to fix this before Chrome 66 is released. I am not criticising my employer or the security team, however this isn’t something Google can just “ &lt;strong>fix&lt;/strong> “.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The certificates issued were issued by a CA that had issues so in order to maintain the trustworthiness of all certificates Google had little choice but to distrust them. Google and security experts need to be making more of a fuss about this and I am joining in on making a fuss by writing this blog. &lt;a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/are-you-ready-for-the-symantec-distrust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Helme&lt;/a>
estimates that there are about 7000 websites which may be affected by the M66 and M70 distrusts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Content Security Policies</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/content-security-policies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/content-security-policies/</guid><description>&lt;p>A content Security Policy or CSP is a HTTP response header that defines what sources of content can be loaded on a web page. It is a way to combat Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-xss-attack-then">What is a XSS attack then?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-is-a-xss-attack-then">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you load a webpage it also loads various other resources like images, some css style sheets, various javascript files that you want to run and probably many other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you know that you can trust all of these things? If you created them and they live under you control then the answer is probably yes. However these days you will probably want to use resources from across the internet, like youtube videos, google analytics, disqus comments, jquery libraries from a cdn etc and you can’t be sure exactly what they are doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine you had a page which you could add any text into a form which would then be displayed. A malicious user could add evil javascript or get the browser to load evil code from anywhere on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="csp-to-the-rescue">CSP to the rescue!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#csp-to-the-rescue">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A CSP allows the browser to only load from sources that you specify. You could specify that resources from your own site will load but the evil script will not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at some examples&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy: script-src &amp;#39;self&amp;#39;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This allows &lt;code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags to only load from the current webhost. script-src is not the only keyword you can use, let’s look at some of the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>script-src&lt;/strong> – control what &lt;code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>style-src&lt;/strong> – control what css will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>img-src&lt;/strong> – control what images will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>frame-src&lt;/strong> – control what frames will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>font-src&lt;/strong> – control what fonts will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>object-src&lt;/strong> – control what object tags will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>connect-src&lt;/strong> – control what resources a script can connect to&lt;br>
&lt;strong>media-src&lt;/strong> – controls what media (audio/video) will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>default-src&lt;/strong> – if no specific rule exists then the default directive will run&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This allows any content to be loaded from any site as long as it comes from a secure (https) site&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https://example.com
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This allows any content to be loaded from &lt;a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://example.com&lt;/a>
only.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-this-on-my-site">How do I use this on my site?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-do-i-use-this-on-my-site">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have added CSPs into my web.config which works great for my .Net Framework code.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code> &amp;lt;system.webServer&amp;gt; &amp;lt;httpProtocol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;customHeaders&amp;gt; &amp;lt;add name=&amp;#34;Content-Security-Policy&amp;#34; value=&amp;#34;default-src https://example.com&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/customHeaders&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/httpProtocol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/system.webServer&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>For .net core it is a bit more complex as you don’t tend to use web.config files, however check out Anthony Chu’s &lt;a href="https://anthonychu.ca/post/aspnet-core-csp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post&lt;/a>
, which has a solution to that problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="report-only">Report Only&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#report-only">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One last thing about CSPs to mention is the Report Only flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only

If you want to sign up to pluralsight as well use this link &lt;a href="http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4&lt;/a>
to get money off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pluralsight is a website that sells training videos on a wide variety of technical topics. You sign up for a monthly or annual subscription and you can watch over 6000 courses whenever and where ever you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not a big fan of videos as if I am sat in front of a screen I would rather be building something, however I do spend a lot of time listening to podcasts. So I have decided to convert this time to listening to pluralsight videos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we assume that by not seeing the visual portion of the videos you lose out on 75% of the learning (This is just a guesstimate I am not sure what the exact figure is or how you would calculate it). However this is still 25% more learning than if I hadn’t signed up at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I signed up I have listened to over 27 hours of technical videos. These have covered topics like C#, Security, Xamarin, MVVM, Interfaces, Getting Involved and Clean architecture. The number one thing I have learnt is that there is a lot that I still don’t understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said I would like to think that since starting to listen to pluralsight concepts have gone from being unknown unknowns (I don’t know about them and I don’t understand them) to known unknowns (I know about them but don’t yet fully understand them)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To keep track of your learning pluralsight has some tests which you can complete. I am particularly proud of my score on the Azure test which ranks me as an expert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why not check out what you can learn from pluralsight?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flexible Architecture with Interfaces</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/flexible-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/flexible-architecture/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have blogged a few times about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/interfaces/">interfaces&lt;/a>
, and how useful they are for producing good quality maintainable code. Let’s look at a problem and the solution I came up with which I am quite proud of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As previously mentioned I am in the process of moving &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2018/01/22/moving-blobs-cloud-suppliers/">images&lt;/a>
from AWS to Azure blob storage. Now that the actual files themselves have been moved I need to change the code that references them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I could find all the code that uses the AWS API and replace it with the Azure API but I am not very good at predicting the future, we may stay on Azure for a while, we may move to AWS or Google Cloud, or we may want to go back to files sitting on a server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets try and code a solution that is as flexible as possible. As you have probably guessed I am going to create an interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first I thought about creating an interface called &lt;strong>ICloudStorage&lt;/strong> , however this isn’t flexible enough as what happens if we go back to sticking files on a server so instead I created &lt;strong>IStorage&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created three classes that implemented IStorage, &lt;strong>AWSStorage&lt;/strong> , &lt;strong>AzureStorage&lt;/strong> and mostly for testing at the moment &lt;strong>FileStorage&lt;/strong>. I then created a class Storage that would call these three classes. Initially I created it like this&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Storage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> IStorage &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Storage(IStorage repo)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However this would require I call it like Storage(new AzureStorage()) and I would need to know everywhere in my code which implementation I want to use. This isn’t too bad as when we change from AWS to Azure we would need to do a find and replace throughout the code and replace all AWSStorage and make them AzureStorage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However we can do better than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Storage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> IStorage &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Storage()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Type obj = Type.GetType(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;DefaultStorageRepository&amp;#34;&lt;/span>]);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> ConstructorInfo constructor = obj.GetConstructor(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Type[] { });
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = (IStorage)constructor.Invoke(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This code will read from the web.config which implementation to use and that will decide which class to call. This means that to change from AWS to Azure we do not need to redeploy any code, all we need to do is change the web.config.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at the three lines and see if we can understand what is happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Type.GetType()&lt;/strong> looks straight forward and gets the type from the web.config&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>obj.GetConstructor()&lt;/strong> This gets the constructor for the type we have just found.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>constructor.Invoke&lt;/strong> This then invokes the constructor and it then gets cast to the interface so can be used by the _repo variable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all fairly simple and makes sense, however it has produced some very flexible code and allows the code to be extended without recompiling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at a hypothetical example. We want to add support for Google Cloud Storage. All we need to do is create a class library which implements the IStorage interface, place the compiled binary in the website and update the web.config to reference it. I haven’t tried this hypothetical example so it might be more complex than I think but in theory it should work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am pretty excited at how flexible this code can be, hopefully I will use code like this more often now I understand it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving files into blob storage</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/moving-blobs-cloud-suppliers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/moving-blobs-cloud-suppliers/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are in the process of moving our companies websites onto the Azure platform. One of the challenges was to move image files out of the website project into blob storage. This week I have moved 150,000 of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I keep banging on about is that your source code should not contain data. If it does every time you do a deployment you need to consider where these images are located and ensure you don’t overwrite or loose any. It also goes without saying that deployments of a few Mb are a lot quicker than deployments of 100s of Mb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure blob storage also gives you advantages like distributing storage across multiple datacenters which would be impossible with traditional files on a server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now that we have established that this is a good idea lets look at how we could move large amounts of data. In my case all the filenames are stored in a SQL database so the plan of action was to simply loop through the files in the database, download from current storage (either locally or other cloud storage), upload to Azure and tidy up afterwards. Due to the number of images I am going to update the database and mark when a file has been processed so I can do the move over several days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> source = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://example.com/images/&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> tmp = Server.MapPath(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;~/tmp/&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (!Directory.Exists(tmp))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Directory.CreateDirectory(tmp);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> fixturePhotos = db.Images.Where(x =&amp;gt; x.Moved == &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span> || x.Moved == &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>).Take(id);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> photo &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">in&lt;/span> fixturePhotos)

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">try&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> path = getFilePath(photo.FileName);

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Directory.CreateDirectory(Server.MapPath(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;~/tmp/&amp;#34;&lt;/span> + path));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> WebClient WebClient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> WebClient();

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> System.IO.File.Delete(tmp + photo.FileName);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> photo.Moved = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">catch&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> photo.Moved = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>db.SaveChanges();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (Directory.Exists(tmp))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Directory.Delete(tmp, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>First of all I create a tmp folder in the root of my website if it doesn’t exist to store my images temporarily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use an entity framework model to query the database that haven’t been moved, and I use the take() method to limit how many results I process. (I have been passing in 1000 at a time)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use a foreach loop over all these files to perform the following actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create additional subfolders if the filename variable stored in the database isn’t actually a filename but a filepath, note you will have to split filename and filepath which I haven’t included code for here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download file from the original url and save into the temporary folder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upload to Azure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Delete temporary file&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Update database giving a success or fail&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once the foreach is finished I commit the database changes and delete the temporary folder. I am sure there must be other ways to do this transfer but this was quick and easy to setup and now I have a copy of all the files in Azure storage so I can test out other issues with my website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last tip about how to schedule this code. I called the above code from a MVC controller and then wrote a Azure Function to call this code on a schedule.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website UI Testing</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/website-ui-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/website-ui-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I looked at testing the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/funkysi1701/mobile-app-ui-testing-jgg-temp-slug-9433902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI of mobile apps&lt;/a>
, this week lets look at how we could do a similar thing for websites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing the user interface is not an excuse for a lack of &lt;a href="https://dev.to/funkysi1701/writing-your-first-test-53gi-temp-slug-2645725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unit tests&lt;/a>
. Testing the user interface takes longer so for keep creating your small unit tests that can be run after ever build. That said lets look at how you create a UI test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a Unit Test project as normal. Now install the following nuget packages&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriverSelenium.WebDriverSelenium.WebDriver.PhantomJS.Xplatform
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I am going to be using Selenium to achieve my website testing and I am going to concentrate on the Chrome browser. However packages exist for other browsers so have a look at the following and I expect there are others as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Selenium.WebDriver.IEDriverSelenium.Firefox.WebDriver
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium&lt;/a>
started life as a plugin for Firefox to help create automated tests, however the latest version of Firefox is not compatible with the plugin as I write this. I have not had to install any plugins or extensions to my browsers to achieve my testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough talk lets write a test. First we create two instance variables to store the baseURL and the driver for the browser you are using.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> baseURL = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.example.com/&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> RemoteWebDriver driver;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next we need to set things up for the test to run. This creates an instance of the chrome driver, maximizes the window and sets it to wait 30 seconds before timing out.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[TestInitialize()]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> MyTestInitialize()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ChromeDriver();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Manage().Window.Maximize();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitlyWait(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">30&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now comes the actual test. We navigate to a URL and then compare the title of the page loaded with a know value with a Assert statement like you would find in a unit test.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[TestMethod]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> CheckBrowserTitle()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">this&lt;/span>.baseURL);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Assert.AreEqual(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Home Page&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, driver.Title);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finally we need to tidy up after ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[TestCleanup()]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> MyTestCleanup()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Quit();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you are used to writing tests you will know that the are usually constructed in three sections Arrange, Act and Assert. The Arrange is done in the initialize method, which makes the actual test much simpler, the first line does the Act and the last line does the Assert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have written a simple test lets look at something more complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>driver.FindElementByLinkTest(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;click&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This finds any Link on the page which is click. Be careful as the string need to be exactly what appears on screen it may well be easier to specify by id or class or something that doesn’t change as often. By adding .click() on the end of this command Selenium will click on the link and you can navigate to a new page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What about submitting form data?&lt;/strong> Well you can find the element you want to fill in and add .SendKeys(&amp;ldquo;example text&amp;rdquo;) or .Submit() and this will fill in and submit form data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What about a screenshot?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="buy-a-house">Buy a house&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#buy-a-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="House" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LEGO-Classic-10703-Creative-Building-Box-Yellow-House.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This a huge goal for me. For many years I was content with renting and thought owning my own home wasn’t for me, but then I went and started a family and my career started going in the right direction and my thoughts about this have changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is going to take a lot of work to make this goal happen in 2018. First I need to save enough money for the deposit, which is far from easy with a wife and two children. Second I need to get our current place sorted ready to physically move which again won’t be easy. Third I need to make a decision which will affect where I live for the next 25 years. At the moment I am torn between the size of property and its physical location, I need to balance both of these and meet the requirements from the rest of the family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do think this is an achievable goal so wish me luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="progress-in-my-career">Progress in my career&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#progress-in-my-career">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I need to be careful how I phrase this in case past, current or future employers are reading. I have been working hard at my current role for over a year and I am starting to wonder what is next for me. I am not entirely sure what form this is going to take yet, I have a few ideas on the go and hopefully I can reveal more soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another one that is very achievable, as long as I have it in the back of my mind as the year goes on progress should be made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="see-more-of-family">See more of family&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#see-more-of-family">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I recently missed a family celebration due to the expansion of my own family and it reminded me that there are aunts, uncles and cousins that I haven’t seen in years and it would be nice to reconnect. Also as my own boys get older and are learning to interact it would be great if they could get to know my own family better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t have a clear idea how to achieve this one as it takes two but I am going to make more of an effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">Celebrate 5 years of marriage&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Wow how has it been five years since we got married? At some point in 2018 I will take time out from the usual and spend it with the wife away from the boys. I won’t give away more details as I want that to be a surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-the-birth-of-my-two-sons">Celebrate the birth of my two sons&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-the-birth-of-my-two-sons">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t want to get my boys christened as I would like them to make up their own minds when they are old enough, however I do want to celebrate all that they are with a thanksgiving service. Not sure when we are going to sort this, however it is my hope that it will be soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="family-holiday">Family holiday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#family-holiday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not much of a goal but in the summer I will take time out to spend a week away with the family. In previous years we have done scotland, wales and northumberland. This year I am thinking of somewhere not too far away as Edward is still small, but maybe near where I grew up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A lightning talk is a very short talk or presentation given at a conference or user group. Friends of mine are having lots of success talking about what they know about and I think it might be time for me to have a go. I am not a natural public speaker so this is a step out of my comfort zone, however I am going to start small and see what happens. At the moment I don’t know what my subject or topic is going to be, my suspicion is that it will be devops related as that interest me more but watch this space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back at 2017</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/looking-back-at-2017/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/looking-back-at-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>As 2017 starts to draw to a close let’s look at some of the highlights from the past year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Edward" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC_0376-e1510563039193-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Edward&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In November I became a father again and celebrated the arrival of Edward into the world. Before the birth I was worried how well my first son James would adapt to the new arrival but I am happy to say I didn’t need to, he mostly ignores the new arrival.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Star Trek&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In September the latest Star Trek TV series Discovery arrived on Netflix. I have been very positive so far about the show, I am still positive however there are things that annoy me about the new show, however I am keen to see the next episode each week so they are definitely doing something right.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Office move&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In May I helped my employer move to brand new &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/office-move" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offices&lt;/a>
. This was a lot of hard work, but everything went as planned and our new home is great.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Side projects &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Google Play" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/googleplay.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I blogged in February about having a side project but it wasn’t until later in the year that this solidified into what I am working on now. It started as a way to understand &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/interfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interfaces&lt;/a>
this then led to learning Xamarin and creating an android app to help promote this blog. Troy Hunt expanded his HIBP API to include passwords that have been in data breaches, I then started working on &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/pwned-pass--available-from-the-play-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pwned passwords&lt;/a>
which is a simple android frontend for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Learning R&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In Feb I also experimented with a new programming language &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/learning-r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R&lt;/a>
. It started with a problem about converting exchange rates and ended with a SQL stored procedure that executed some R code, I still want to learn lots more but it was a good example of the sorts of thing you can build with R.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>DNS programmatically&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>One of my most successful blogs was about how you can create &lt;a href="https://dev.to/funkysi1701/creating-dns-records-programmatically-1o3c-temp-slug-3062796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dns&lt;/a>
records within your application eg sites that have yourname.domain in the url. It was a great chance to look at how dns works and learn more about what azure can do to manage this. I want to expand on this and build something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that was 2017, for some ideas about what 2018 might have in store for me look out for my next blog post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting started with Azure Table Storage</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-table-storage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-table-storage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Azure Table storage is cheap way to store data, however it has some drawbacks that you should be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure Table storage is a simple way to store NoSQL data with key/attribute pairs. I am very familiar with storing data in SQL databases and would still choose SQL over Table storage, however Table storage is significantly cheaper so could be worth investigating depending on your project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/working-with-154-million-records-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troy Hunt&lt;/a>
makes use of Table storage for his Have I been pwned? website so there are projects out there that make use of it to great affect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work with Table storage you need to use a nuget package &lt;strong>WindowsAzure.Storage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Install-Package WindowsAzure.Storage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To load data from a Table in Azure Table storage I use the following code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudTableClient tableClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;tablename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TableOperation retrieveOperation = TableOperation.Retrieve&amp;lt;Entity&amp;gt;(PartitionKey, Rowkey);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>table.CreateIfNotExists();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TableResult retrievedResult = table.Execute(retrieveOperation);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Example eg = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Example();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (retrievedResult.Result != &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> eg.ID = ((Entity)retrievedResult.Result).Id;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> eg.Date = ((Entity)retrievedResult.Result).Date;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> eg;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You need to create a class (called Entity in the example above) derived from TableEntity which defines the Partitionkey and Rowkey, plus and other columns you want to store in table storage. The row key and partition key uniquely identify the data in the table, think of this as the primary key of the table if you are used to SQL. This class must also contain a parameterless constructor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the only way to retrieve data, using the partitionkey and rowkey. If you want to retrieve a specific piece of data you would need to retrieve all rows and then search them for what you need. For me this is not a big problem as I only have 150 rows but if you have millions of rows you may need to think carefully how to use this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To save data I use a very similar piece of code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(path);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudTableClient tableClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;tablename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Entity post = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Entity(ID, DateTime.Now);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TableOperation insertOperation = TableOperation.InsertOrReplace(post);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>table.CreateIfNotExists();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>table.Execute(insertOperation);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I create a Entity object and then pass this as a parameter into the InsertOrReplace method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To delete data it is also very similar, you create an entity object and pass this as a parameter to the Delete method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When debugging my table storage code I found the &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/storage-explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Storage Explorer&lt;/a>
very useful for seeing what data actually existed in the table and what might be throwing an error, usually something wrong with my Entity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mentioned earlier that Table Storage was cheaper than SQL Azure. Well for my simple playing about with things I have found my monthly charge of £10+ has been reduced to £1+ If I were to build anything that is more than just me learning about how it works I would probably continue to use SQL but for the cost of learning new tech it is well worth giving table storage a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to get Zero Code Changes outside of Source Control</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/get-zero-code-changes-outside-source-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/get-zero-code-changes-outside-source-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>Source control is bread and butter for web developers, however not so much for SQL developers and other business people. One of my goals for the coming year is to get the whole of my team using source control processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the arguments against using source control is there will always be a few exceptions where it won’t be used. Lets look at a few scenarios to help make the case for source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario One&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web Dev 1 makes a change in production to fix an issue and doesn’t use source control. Web Dev 2 is working on a new feature and makes use of source control. He is given the sign-off to deploy his new feature and in the process undoes Web Dev 1’s fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management blames Web Dev 2 as they “broke” stuff during the deployment. Web Dev 2 doesn’t understand what happened and Web Dev 1 is oblivious to the entire scenario despite in reality being part of the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario Two&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A SQL Dev works all night to fix a problem. He deploy to production and doesn’t notice a missed where clause due to lack of sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at these two scenarios done with the whole team buying into source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario One&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web Dev 1 makes a change in production to fix an issue and also commits to source control. This takes him an extra 5 minutes (if that!) Web Dev 2 is working on a new feature and makes use of source control. He is given the sign-off to deploy his new feature and in the process merges Web Dev 1’s fix before he deploys to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management is happy with Web Dev 1, nothing is broken and new functionality has made the website better not worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario Two&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A SQL Dev works all night to fix a problem. He deploy to production and doesn’t notice a missed where clause due to lack of sleep, he also commits to source control this takes him an extra 5 minutes (if that!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the morning a colleague looks through the commits made during the night and queries the missing where clause. A fix is made in source control and deployed, management and the client are unaware that a problem was created and fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are simple scenarios but I cannot think of any situation where the outcome would be better to not use source control. These examples assume no continuous deployment, adding this to the system before every team has bought into source control would cause bugs and issues all over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However with a team that is 100% behind source control continuous deployment can achieve an amazing productivity boost. After every commit code could be automatically tested, reviewed by other members of the team and deployed to test environments for further analysis. Only tested code that has been reviewed can get anywhere near production environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said all this there are ways especially on the SQL side to mitigate loosing changes while you work on training individuals and convincing management. Before any code is deployed to production do a schema compare. If you only see changes you have made you can proceed, if you don’t shout at your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code Reviews&lt;br>
Team awareness of what is being changed&lt;br>
History of changes&lt;br>
Smoother Deployments&lt;br>
Automation&lt;br>
Better Teamwork&lt;br>
Diff changes between different versions&lt;br>
Many more&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disadvantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time to learn tools&lt;br>
Remember to commit changes&lt;br>
Technologies that use binary files harder to version control&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQL with Visual Studio Code</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-with-visual-studio-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-with-visual-studio-code/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing SQL queries is typically done with SQL Management Studio (SSMS). However this tool is a bit of a beast so let’s look at how you could use Visual Studio Code instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio Code is a free text editor but it is so much more than just a text editor. VS Code can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com/Download&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work with SQL Server download the mssql extension. Press &lt;strong>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/strong> and then Select &lt;strong>Install Extension&lt;/strong> and type &lt;strong>mssql&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intellisense in Visual Studio Code is brilliant, better than SSMS. Lets look at how to get it all set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new file and set the language type to SQL (Press &lt;strong>CTRL+K,M&lt;/strong> )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open the command palette, &lt;strong>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/strong> and type SQL to show the mssql commands. Select the Connect command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then select &lt;strong>Create Connection Profile&lt;/strong> , this creates a profile to connect with your SQL Server. Follow the prompts to get it all setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look in the bottom right corner of the status bar and you should see you are connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you type sql you will see a long list of SQL code snippets that you could use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-sql-snippets.png?resize=662%2C348&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a snippet to create, and edit it as required. When you are happy press **CTRL+SHIFT+E ** to execute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is basically all there is to it. However this is an incredibly powerful way of working, the intellisense instantly tells you what database objects you can use in your query and there is a wealth of different snippets you can use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When returning data you get a similar view to SSMS but you can save as Excel, CSV or JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SSMS is a very graphical way of doing things, you can double click a table and see its columns or indexes. VS Code relies on TSQL commands but you have access to exactly the same information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information about VS Code and the mssql extension check out &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode&lt;/a>

about learning about interfaces as I didn’t really understand the value of them. I do now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created an application that used interfaces so I could learn how it worked. I created a Logger Interface and created multiple classes that implemented that interface so I could swap out the different implementations easily. I created a SQL Logger and a File Logger and my code could be written and be completely unaware of which implementation it was using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This application uses SQL Azure and so I have a monthly bill to pay. Wouldn’t it be cool if I could reduce this bill? How about using the cheaper table storage instead?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Easy!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new class that implements my interface and all I need to do is write the three methods defined in my interface and I can swap from SQL Azure to table storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit to interfaces is testing. Say I have an interface called inotification for sending notifications, I can have several implementations of this email, twitter, slack etc&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of these implementations should be used in unit tests, as you don’t want a tweet being sent every time you run your tests. Why not create an implementation that simply returns something for each method call and doesn’t actually do anything. I can then run my tests with my fake implementation which tests my code logic but not the implementation I have chosen (this can be tested later on with integration tests or user testing if required).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is pretty much all I have to say about interfaces. I just like how I can swap different implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It does take a bit of work to get the interface setup. I found that when writing the second implementation the interface would need to change slightly, mostly as it was badly designed to begin with. I think for beginners there may be some value to writing multiple implementations of an interface so you can be sure your interface is good, however I am sure with experience this will not be required.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating DNS records programmatically</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/creating-dns-records-programmatically/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/creating-dns-records-programmatically/</guid><description>&lt;p>DNS is the backbone of the internet. It converts domain names into IP addresses. But how can we do clever things with it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making DNS changes has always been a pain. You have to remember what company you registered your domain name with, then locate the login details for their website, login and fill in some web form and wait for the changes to replicate across the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are various websites that assign you a custom subdomain name like name.domain.com, obviously they must do this programmatically, they don’t have a guy following the above process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets see how we could do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first thought was to make use of the DNSimple API. &lt;a href="https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/&lt;/a>
The API allows all sort of DNS changes to be made, however this is a paid service so let’s look at other options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure now has a DNS section. You can go to the portal, add a DNS zone, and then add as many A, CNAME and MX records as you need. This is of course no better than doing it manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure offers a &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDK&lt;/a>
and an example Visual Studio project. Lets look at how it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need to setup some credentials to use your Azure subscription. The easiest way to do this is with powershell.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Login&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>AzureRmAccount
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$sp = New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>DisplayName exampleapp &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>Password &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;{provide-password}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Sleep 20
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>New-AzureRmRoleAssignment &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>RoleDefinitionName Contributor &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>ServicePrincipalName $sp.ApplicationId
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will create a AD Service Principal which has access to your Azure subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to get the following IDs from the Azure portal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>subscriptionId for your subscription&lt;br>
tenantId or the Azure AD Directory ID&lt;br>
applicationId of the service principal created above&lt;br>
password you entered into the powershell script above&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> serviceCreds = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> ApplicationTokenProvider.LoginSilentAsync(tenantId, clientId, secret);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> dnsClient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> DnsManagementClient(serviceCreds);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>dnsClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> recordSetParams = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> RecordSet();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>recordSetParams.TTL = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">3600&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>recordSetParams.ARecords = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> List&amp;lt;ARecord&amp;gt;();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>recordSetParams.ARecords.Add(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ARecord(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;1.2.3.4&amp;#34;&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> recordSet = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> dnsClient.RecordSets.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;funkysi1701.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, RecordType.A, recordSetParams);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The above code connects to Azure and creates an A record for test.funkysi1701.com that points at the ip address 1.2.3.4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other DNS records can be created in a similar way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above example creates a new RecordSet but you can use the following to delete or get existing records.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> recordSet = dnsClient.RecordSets.Get(resourceGroupName, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;funkysi1701.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, RecordType.A);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>dnsClient.RecordSets.Delete(resourceGroupName, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;funkysi1701.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, RecordType.A);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now I have found out that I can write a console app to edit my DNS records I need to change the nameservers for all my domains so I can take advantage of this new feature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure Friday</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-friday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-friday/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think Azure is great, but there is loads to it so I can never know about all of its features. There is a video series hosted by Scott Hanselman called &lt;a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Fridays&lt;/a>
which I have started to watch in an effort to keep more up to date about some of its cool features.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I watched this video recently and it is all about application insights and new ways you can debug your web applications by creating snapshots. I am a big fan of application insights so adding extra ways to debug my apps is a big win for me.

, Azure Function is another way of doing the same thing, lets look at how they work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Sorry its been a while since I blogged but I suspect an erratic schedule will continue for the next few months.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create an Azure Function go to the Azure portal and click add new and search for &amp;ldquo;Function App&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give your app a name and select the usual resource group and location settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now when you open Function Apps you should see your new app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want my Function App to run on a schedule so I clicked the + next to functions and selected TimerTrigger. I am a c# programmer so I selected this option as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give your function a name and specify using the usual cron notation how often it should run. I want mine to run at 9.30pm each night so use 0 30 21 * * *&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now comes the code bit. By default you get a window with the following code in it&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">$&amp;#34;C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It is entirely up to you what you get your function to do. In my case I just wanted to call a URL on a schedule so I created some code that used httpclient.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System.Net.Http;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">$&amp;#34;Buffer 0 function executed at: {DateTime.Now}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> HttpClient client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> HttpClient();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> result = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> client.GetAsync(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;URL&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> resultContent = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(resultContent);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once you have created your app and it has run you can use the monitor section to view success and failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is loads more you can do with Azure Function but this is a good place to start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pwned Pass – Available from the Play Store</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/pwned-pass-available-from-the-play-store/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/pwned-pass-available-from-the-play-store/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pwned Pass is now available from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Pwned Pass" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170813-205152.png?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pwned Pass is a simple android app that allows you to type in a password and tells you if it has been used in a data breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt of &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Have I Been Pwned?&lt;/a>
recently added a new API to his website which allows you to search his extensive database of pwned passwords, 306 million of them. I have simply created a Android frontend to this API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The API itself takes a SHA1 hash of the password and either returns a HTTP 200 if the password is found or a HTTP 404 if the password does not exist in the HIBP database. For more details of how Troy Hunt created this check out his &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My app simply generates a SHA1 hash of anything that is typed in and then passes this to Troy Hunt’s API. I then get the HTTP return code so I know if the password exists or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be noted that: &lt;strong>Do not send any password you actively use to a third-party service – even this one!&lt;/strong> I don’t log anything that you type into my app and all I am then doing is passing a SHA1 hash over SSL to HIBP. However you shouldn’t trust my word alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app itself is written in Visual Studio with Xamarin Forms in a similar fashion to the app I talked about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre">last week&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I am using Xamarin Forms there is the potential that I may develop iPhone or UWP versions of this code in the future. With that in mind I have made use of interfaces for the android specific parts of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also make use of the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/modernhttpclient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modernhttpclient&lt;/a>
nuget package due to problems I encountered with httpclient and SSL. This is due to limitations of what libraries are available in mono and what has been implemented, I suspect there are better ways to solve this but that is all part of the fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please do have a look at Pwned Pass and let me know what you think. Especially if it doesn’t work or throws errors. I would like to spend time making this app as good as I can make it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Android App Development and the Visual Studio Mobile Centre</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past week or so I have been playing around with Xamarin and creating an android app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well I now have an app in the Google Play Store. Check out &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6148298088834956775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6148298088834956775&lt;/a>
. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170806-190053.png?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you rush and download the app I must warn you that it doesn’t do much yet. It displays some content that is on my website and there are a few links to allow sharing of content. I have some ideas to display content from my blog and allow sharing. I also have some other ideas for apps that might actually be useful to people that are not me. If you have ideas or feature requests do let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok how did I go about creating this app and getting it in the app store?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xamarin is now part of Visual Studio so step one is install all the Xamarin features to Visual Studio and build an app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I wanted to monitor my app. Now I know Application Insights doesn’t support apps so what tools are out there? HockeyApp is something I had heard of but they are in the process of being replaced with &lt;a href="https://appcenter.ms/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Mobile Centre&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was relatively easy to hook up my app to Visual Studio Mobile Centre. First install the required nuget packages. Then add using statements and the following line to your MainActivity.cs file (these instructions are available on the Mobile Centre)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Analytics;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Crashes;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Distribute;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Push;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>MobileCenter.Start(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;[Unique ID]&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Analytics), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Crashes), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Distribute), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Push));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now you can connect the Mobile Centre to your source code (VSTS in my case) and get it to run a build for every commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One complexity of the build is that you need to supply a keystore file (basically a certificate to digitally sign your app). I found the best way to do this was to use Visual Studio to create the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In VS2017 there is a option called Archive Manager under the tools menu. In here click the distribute button and select Ad-hoc. In the signing identity section you can create a keystore file. Enter a few details and a keystore file will be created in AppData\Local\Xamarin\Mono for Android\Keystore[keystore name][keystore name.keystore]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have added the keystore file to your build you can enable the distribute option. Now you will get an email after every build with a link to install your app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time your app crashes the details will be logged in the crashes section for you to explore and fix the issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Analytics section allows you to explore how your app is being used. You can also add Analytics.TrackEvent(&amp;ldquo;Feature X&amp;rdquo;) to measure the usage of different features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are more things you can do which I will explore more at another time along with how to get your app into the Google Play Store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating your own nuget packages with VSTS</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/creating-nuget-packages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/creating-nuget-packages/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while I have found myself writing the same bits of code for different web projects. This annoys me as it goes against the DRY principle (don’t repeat yourself).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Nuget" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nuget.png?resize=300%2C91&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
One possible solution is to write your own nuget packages. You can then add this piece of code to any project you work on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuget.org&lt;/a>
is the public nuget feed where any developer can download nuget packages. You could publish your nuget package here, but your might want to restrict access so better to create a private nuget feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at how we create a nuget feed in Visual Studio. First thing you need to do is install the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Package Management&lt;/a>
extension to Visual Studio Team Services (its free for less than 5 users), this will add a packages section under the build menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you can start using this new feature you need to add a Package Management License in the users hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once that is done you can create a feed. You need to give your feed a name, decide if only members of the current project or everyone in your account should have access to read and contribute to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you have a feed you could use the nuget package command to create a nupkg file and then nuget push command to add it to your feed. A better way is to get Visual Studio Team Services to do all the hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new project in Visual Studio Team Service to house your nuget package. In the build section add an empty build definition. Choose a build agent, I am using the Hosted VS2017. Then add the following steps nuget restore, Visual Studio Build, nuget pack and nuget push.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>nuget restore – this step is only needed if your code depends on other packages. If it depends on other packages that are only in your feed you must specify your feed in the feeds and authentication section.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visual Studio Build – this builds your code like you would in Visual Studio. The only config I made to this step was to specify Release in configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nuget pack – this creates the nupkg file from your built project. In configuration to package specify the same as you specified in the previous step (in my case Release)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nuget push – this publishes to your feed, so of course you need to specify your feed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One last thing to configure is to enable the continuous integration option in triggers. This means whenever you push code all these steps will run and you have a new version of your nuget package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Visual Studio you need to create a *.nuspec file, this contains all the meta data about your nuget package. Let look at an example.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;package&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;metadata&amp;gt;&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>One last thing to mention is version numbers. You can either change the version number in your *.nuspec file everytime you push changes. This will create stable packages like 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 etc&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However you can use the automatic version number setting in the nuget pack build step. However I have found this only ever creates pre-release packages and I haven’t found a way to upgrade a package from pre-release to stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a really neat way to reuse your code in multiple projects. I have only been looking at this for a few days and I have already extracted code to do with emails, creating excel downloads and database related methods. I suspect that doing this will also have a side benefit of forcing me to create code with fewer dependencies so more code can be turned into a nuget package.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Async and Await</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/async-and-await/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/async-and-await/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while the Async and Await commands in c# have confused me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like most things the best way to learn about something is to use it in a real world example. I am currently adding an email alert feature to a website. This is an ideal example of something that would benefit from Asynchronous programming. There is no need for the webpage to wait to send 1000s of emails, lets just send a call to get started and allow the browser to carry on as normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my first try at using async and await so feel free to suggest best practises in the comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start with a Send method in my EmailController.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> ActionResult Send(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> id, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> pageId, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> userID)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (!Authorize.checkPageIsAuthorised(userID, (Authorize.PageIds)pageId))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Redirect(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;/login&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Task&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>&amp;gt; t = SendNotifications(id,userID);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Redirect(Request.UrlReferrer.ToString());
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This simply checks to see if you have permission to the page. If not redirects to the login page otherwise it makes a method call and redirects back to the page it came from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets have a look at that method call in more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Task&lt;string> t = SendNotification(id, userid);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SendNotification doesn’t return a normal string it returns a Task&lt;string>, so lets look at how we are creating this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>&amp;gt; SendNotifications(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> id,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> type,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> userid)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//logic ommitted&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> ef.SendEmail(model, emailHtmlBody);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The return type is set to Task but it has the aysnc keyword appended to it. It also makes a call with the await keyword.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task SendEmail(EmailModel model,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> emailHtmlBody)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//logic removed&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> smtp.SendMailAsync(message);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So that is it. My first bit of code that uses Async and Await. My controller calls a method asynchronously which then calls another method asynchronously which sends emails asynchronously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Async – This enables the Await keyword to be used in the method&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Await – This is where things get asynchronous. The await keyword allows the code to wait asynchronously for the long running code to complete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing your first test</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/writing-your-first-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/writing-your-first-test/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whenever I write a new test I have to think how best to do it. Hopefully I can summarise a few tips here to help get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="arrange-act-assert">Arrange Act Assert&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#arrange-act-assert">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first thing I think about when writing a test is Arrange, Act, Assert. Arrange, Act, Assert is a pattern for writing the tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arrange&lt;/strong> – This gets things in order ready to execute the test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Act&lt;/strong> – This executes the method you want to test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Assert&lt;/strong> – This compares the value produced in the Act step with a known value typically with a method similar to the following&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assert.AreEqual(expected value, actual value)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Say for example you wanted to test a method called ReturnsTrue() which does nothing but returns a value of true. This method is in a class called ReturnsTrueClass&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Arrange step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ReturnsTrueClass t = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ReturnsTrueClass();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The Act step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> result = t.ReturnTrue();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The Assert step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Assert.AreEqual(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>, result);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is a stupidly simple example but hopefully you get the idea of how you can build all your tests with these three steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I saw a tweet complaining that someone has mixed up expected and actual in the Assert statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a minor but special hell reserved for those who mix up the expected and actual parameters in Assert.Equals&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Keith Williams (@zogface) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zogface/status/882737770095149056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2017&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>At first glance this probably isn’t the worst mistake to make as if your tests are all passing actual and expected are the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However tests will fail, that is the whole point of them, you can then fix bits of code. If you have mixed up actual and expected it adds extra time to debugging and figuring out what values are produced from your code and what you are expecting it to produce. It may be your test uses a mocking framework and somewhere in there, there is an issue, with mixed up expected/actual you may assume a problem in your code rather than the test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, how do you make such an error? When I type Assert.AreEquals() in Visual Studio, Visual Studio tells me what each parameter does, it takes a matter of seconds to do this, just by hovering over the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last tip to say about tests. Write your tests to test the behaviour of your application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uploading Files to AWS</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/uploading-files-to-aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/uploading-files-to-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a fan of Azure but today I have been looking at AWS. Specifically how to upload and download files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS S3 stores files in Buckets. I already had an AWS S3 account setup with a Bucket. I am going to assume you have got a bucket setup and concentrate on the code to get files in and out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First step is to use nuget to install the AWS packages. In nuget the packages you want are called AWSSDK.Core and AWSSDK.S3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The using statements you want to use are called Amazon.S3 and Amazon.S3.Transfer, not sure why this doesn’t match nuget, this difference caught me out a couple of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to the code that uploads files&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> InputStream = streamWriter,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = fileName
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Lets break it down and look at what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of AmazonS3Client, we are passing the Access Key and Secret Access Key both of which can be found from your Amazon S3 account My Security Credentials section. Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1 specifies the amazon data centres that your bucket is located in.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of TransfterUtility using the AmazonS3Client instance we created in the previous step.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This opens up a filestream from a files path and specifies that the file should be opened.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> InputStream = streamWriter,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = fileName
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>};
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This last step specifies which bucket to upload to, what input stream to upload and the Key to use. Key is just AWS way of referring to files, more commonly referred to as the filename.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all you need to do to upload a file to your Bucket. The file will be located at &lt;a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]&lt;/a>
, however by default it will not be downloadable until you set Read permission to everyone, once you do that anyone who has the link will be able to download your file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the same permission level as any file you have on your webserver, however AWS has a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (s3Client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> GetPreSignedUrlRequest request1 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> GetPreSignedUrlRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = bucketName,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = filename,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Expires = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">5&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> urlString = s3Client.GetPreSignedURL(request1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we are generating a url to download the file, but we are specifying that it is only valid for 5 minutes. This means that if you share the url it will only work for 5 minutes, after that AWS will give an access denied message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is much better security than you have on a typical web server, and easy to implement, every time a user clicks on a download link you generate a new presigned url and send the download to the browser, as long as this process doesn’t take longer than 5 minutes the user will never know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Azure WebJobs to Automate Stuff</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</guid><description>&lt;p>I keep hearing about Azure WebJobs but I have never used them. Time to change this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that can run a script at a specific time. In my case I would like to hit a specific url of my website at the same time every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="WebJobs" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/addkeepalivewebjob.png?resize=313%2C615&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
To the right you can see an example of the WebJobs form on the Azure portal that you need to fill in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to supply a name for your webjob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to upload the script that will run in my case I used a powershell script. My script consisted of which basically just loads the url specified.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$progressPreference = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;silentlyContinue&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri (&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.google.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>) -Method Get -UseBasicParsing;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Type refers to if your job will be triggered or run continuously, I want it to be triggered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Triggers refers to if you want it to be scheduled or manual, something that you can run on an ad hoc basis. I of course want scheduled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are familiar with the linux CRON then the next box will make sense to you for everyone else I will try and make sense of it. The box consists of 6 numbers which can either have a value or a *. The numbers correspond to the following {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hourly job would be expressed as 0 0 * * * *, ie every day of week, every month, every day, every hour and only when minute and second equals zero. For more help with this check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs#CreateScheduledCRON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSDN docs&lt;/a>
about it. I want to use 0 30 21 * * * to run daily at 9.30pm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it everything setup, now time to wait and see if it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Oh no!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It failed to run at the specified time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason for this is the scheduler requires the feature Always On to be turned on which is not available in the free App Service. Before you reach for your wallets, I found a solution on this &lt;a href="https://tomssl.com/2016/12/20/how-to-get-azure-webjobs-to-run-indefinitely-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
that allows them to run on the free tier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thinking behind this solution is you need to keep the website alive throughout the day so Tom has created a script that does this. His script can be found on his blog or on his &lt;a href="https://github.com/TomChantler/Self-KeepAlive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github page&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set this script up to run every 5 minutes (0 */5 * * * *) like the example above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nextthing you need to do is create a Custom connection string in the Application Settings blade called SecretThing. Tom’s script references this to access the website and keep it alive. The password you need to put in SecretThing can be found in you publish profile (downloaded from the Overview blade in the Azure portal). For more details and a better explanation check out &lt;a href="https://tomssl.com/2016/12/20/how-to-get-azure-webjobs-to-run-indefinitely-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom’s blog&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last thing to mention about WebJobs is that you can see details about when they have run at https://[YourWebAppName].scm.azurewebsites.net/azurejobs/#/jobs and this can be a great place to help debug your scripts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What the heck is Business Intelligence?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/businessintelligence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/businessintelligence/</guid><description>&lt;p>The term &lt;strong>Business Intelligence (BI)&lt;/strong> refers to technologies, applications and practices for the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of business information. The purpose of Business Intelligence is to support better business decision making. Essentially, Business Intelligence systems are data-driven Decision Support Systems (DSS). Business Intelligence is sometimes used interchangeably with briefing books, report and query tools and executive information systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-power-bi">What is Power BI?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-is-power-bi">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Power BI&lt;/strong> is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft. It provides interactive visualisations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, where end users can create reports and dashboards by themselves, without having to depend on any information technology staff or database administrator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft describe it as follows: &lt;strong>Power BI&lt;/strong> is a suite of business analytics tools that deliver insights throughout your organisation. Connect to hundreds of data sources, simplify data prep, and drive ad hoc analysis. Produce beautiful reports, then publish them for your organisation to consume on the web and across mobile devices. Everyone can create personalised dashboards with a unique, 360-degree view of their business. And scale across the enterprise, with governance and security built-in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-can-you-do-with-it">What can you do with it?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-can-you-do-with-it">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the first thing you can do with Power Bi is connect some of the apps that you use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To sign up to use Power BI go to &lt;a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are signed in click the get data link in the bottom left corner and browse through the apps you can use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your website uses google analytics you can connect it up to Power BI and see some cool analytics. The below map was generated from some google analytics data, you can see that this website has had users across the globe, with UK and USA getting a lot of hits. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Business Intelligence from Google Analytics" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture.jpg?resize=662%2C349&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing you can do is connect Azure Application Insights. This provides some similar data to google analytics about who is visiting your site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your code is hosted in Visual Studio Team Services you can get some cool analytics from your commit history. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Business Intelligence from VSTS" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture-1.jpg?resize=662%2C177&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a huge long list of apps you can connect to power BI so you can start getting all sorts of analysis very easily. I am hopefully going to talk another time about getting custom data into Power BI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Have I Been Pwned?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/have-i-been-pwned/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/have-i-been-pwned/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you heard of the website &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://haveibeenpwned.com&lt;/a>
?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well you should have. Have I Been Pwned is a website created by security expert Troy Hunt that keeps track of data breaches and allows you to search and find ones that affect you. As I write this &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troy Hunt&lt;/a>
has tracked 3,752,984,562 pwned accounts from 216 pwned websites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-pwned-mean">What does “pwned” mean?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-does-pwned-mean">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>pwn means to compromise or control, specifically another computer (server or PC), website, gateway device, or application. (as defined on wikipedia)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally, pwn and its variants were pronounced /ˈoʊn/ in the same way as the verb own, the tail of the p being “silent”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of this site Troy Hunt defines it as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;quote>A &amp;ldquo;breach&amp;rdquo; is an incident where a hacker illegally obtains data from a vulnerable system, usually by exploiting weaknesses in the software. All the data in the site comes from website breaches which have been made publicly available.&lt;/quote>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-can-i-do">What can I do?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-can-i-do">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As an individual you can search for your email address in Have I Been Pwned, I am in 7 data breaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a person responsible for an email domain you can search and find which of your users are in a data breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also sign up to get notified of any future data breaches you might get caught up in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are in a data breach change your password. If you use the same password across multiple sites or services change them as well. Consider using a &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">password manager&lt;/a>
so you can have unique complex passwords for every services you use and not have to worry about forgetting them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look after a website or service then follow Troy Hunt. Think about security, is your site vulnerable to SQL injection, do you store passwords with reversible encryption?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-worried-should-i-be">How worried should I be?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-worried-should-i-be">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Data breaches are happening more and more often. Its not showing any sign of slowing down, in fact I expect there to be lots more in the years to come. However there are things you can do to mitigate the damage of being in a breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use a password manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don’t share passwords between sites&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Regularly change your passwords&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Think of passwords as pass phrases and include spaces between the different words&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Consider what information a company has about you. How worried would you be if this became public knowledge? Consider if you want this online, weigh up the benefits etc&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HighCharts</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/highcharts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/highcharts/</guid><description>&lt;p>High Charts is a javascript library that allows graphs and charts to easily be added to web pages.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am quite a fan of the different gauges that you can put on your site, as you can add a bit of animation and make the needles bounce around. &lt;a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo/gauge-solid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.highcharts.com/demo/gauge-solid&lt;/a>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As most of the data I deal with lives in a SQL Server database, I have been spending quite a bit of time writing Stored Procedures and functions to mould the data so I can easily pass data from the database to javascript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Highcharts are very flexible with lots of different options that allow you to display charts of almost any data you have, these charts are also exportable as PNG, JPEG, CSVs etc&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitHub history</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/github-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/github-history/</guid><description>&lt;p>I created my GitHub account in August 2010, lets look at what I have done with it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Between 12 December 2010 and 29 September 2011 I must have created some automated process which is why there is a commit every day. Looking at the diff it appears to be related to tracking visitors to a site. I assume back then I hadn’t heard of the .gitignore file!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Nothing for a few years until 2014, when I started compiling a code samples collection, this is bits of code that I want to show off, I have added to this since 2015 so I really should go back to this as my skills have developed a bit since then.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2015 I really started to think of myself as a developer, I added repositories for Raspberry Pi, and a few C# ideas I had. I ended the year taking part in Advent of Code&lt;/p>

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What did I do last year? Well I started going to York Code Dojo and this meant lots of forks from their code examples and also my first pull request. I also did a fair bit of looking at other repositories trying to find a good open source project to contribute to, still not found one for me yet. Lastly I ended 2016 with a bit of Advent of Code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not sure how enthralling a blog post this is, but fascinating to see the different commit histories.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automation of the Promotion of my Blog</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/automation-promotion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/automation-promotion/</guid><description>&lt;p>I would like to automate the promotion of this blog. Currently to promote this blog on social media I use a few different services.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img-buffer-illustration-hub-960@2x.png?w=1780&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buffer (&lt;a href="https://buffer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buffer.com&lt;/a>
) is a service that allows you to schedule updates to the main social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IFTTT or If This Then That (&lt;a href="https://ifttt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ifttt.com&lt;/a>
) is a service that allows you to connect different online services. You can send an email when a specific event occurs in your calendar for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been using a combination of these services to share to social media some of my past blog posts. I then add to my calendar details of my blog posts. Then I use IFTTT to add the event to Buffer, and then buffer tweets on a schedule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This works great however it is a manual process to add my posts to my calendar. I have been using a spreadsheet to help me generate an ics calendar file which I import into my google calendar. There must be a better way of doing this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have written some code that reads the RSS feed of my blog and then shares that to Buffer using the Buffer API. The code I am creating is far from finished however I am trying to use the concepts of clean code to make it as flexible as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have an interface called ISocial which my buffer code implements, but it would be easy to add a class that implements the same interface but uses the twitter or facebook APIs. My code reads from a specific WordPress RSS feed, but it should be easy enough to adapt to read from a SQL database or any other data source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am currently unsure what kind of interface to use for this application. I could create a web page that controls the functionality, or maybe just a windows application, or maybe both of these are complicating things and all I need is just a console application that could be added as a scheduled task.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blame</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/blame/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/blame/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently came home from a busy day of work to my wife blaming me for allowing our 18 month old son to reach some paint and get it all over the carpet. She was concentrating on the fact that he could reach the paint not on the fact that she had brilliantly got the paint out of the carpet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blame-shifting.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My instinct on being blamed is to deny it, or start throwing blame back at her. It is possible I put the paint in his reach, it is also possible it was someone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is very easy to blame someone else. For example, looking through the git history to find out who changed a specific file is only a few clicks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But is it ever productive to blame someone? Is it not better to focus our energy on fixing the issue at hand?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the world of business it is easy to go from blaming other people until you have a blame culture. When you have a blame culture everyone starts looking out for themselves so it’s not them that gets the blame and productivity will suffer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it is more important to put in place​ processes to minimise issues happening again. If a deployment causes downtime, don’t ask who’s fault is it and sack them. Instead what can we do to reduce the chance of it happening again?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As someone who has an interest in DevOps, I often break things and don’t want to get blamed for that, I do want to improve my processes so I am not always breaking the same things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do you think about Blame? Is what can we do differently always better than who did this?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interfaces</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/interfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am trying to understand interfaces and when to use them in my code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interface defines a contract and any class that implements that interface agrees to fulfil that contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at an example as this tends to be how I learn best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most applications require some sort of data to work from so lets start by defining IData which can load data.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">interface&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">IData&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>My interface defines one method LoadData and outputs an object called Blog (I will explain why in a minute)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common data source is a SQL database so we could define a SQL class that implements IData.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">SQL&lt;/span> : IData
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog blog = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Blog();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (SqlConnection con = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> SqlConnection(Connectionstring))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> con.Open();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We could also get data from an RSS feed of a blog (hence why I called the object Blog earlier)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">XML&lt;/span> : IData
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> XmlDocument myXmlDocument = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> XmlDocument();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> myXmlDocument.Load(Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog blog = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Blog();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach&lt;/span> (XmlNode RootNode &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">in&lt;/span> myXmlDocument.ChildNodes)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Both classes implement IData and have a method called LoadData which has a string parameter and outputs a blog object. The string parameter is either a connection string to a SQL database or the URL of the rss feed. Not sure if there is a better way of doing this bit, maybe the name of the string needs making more generic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have some classes that implement an interface what can we do with them. Lets write a class called GetData which gets data but doesn’t care if it comes form the rss feed or a SQL database.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">GetData&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> IData &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> GetData(IData repo)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> original = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo.LoadData(Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> original;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When we call GetData we can either pass in XML or SQL as the class is not tied to either implementation. We could even write other classes that implement IData for testing purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My full code can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/InterfaceExample" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantages of writing code in this way include code that is easier to extend, easier to test and easier to maintain. This is only the start of my understanding and I am sure this is going to be a topic I come back to in the next few weeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SOLID and other programming terms</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/solid-programming-terms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/solid-programming-terms/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week I have been looking at improving my understanding of a few programming terms, like SOLID and I will try and define them so I can look back here when I get confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mvc">MVC&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#mvc">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have previously blogged about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/03/17/model-view-controller-mvc/">MVC&lt;/a>
, but my understanding was not 100% correct so I will refine this here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Model&lt;/strong> – Now this is where my understanding was not quite correct. I thought the model was the actual source data, eg an XML file, SQL database etc. The model is the business logic so this is a processed version of the source data. MVC does not care where data is stored it can be flat files, SQL, XML or anything really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>View&lt;/strong> – This displays data to the user and typically is the HTML/CSS markup. Only display related logic would get included in the view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Controller&lt;/strong> – This is another place I had got a bit confused. I had thought all the logic lived here. This is incorrect controllers are only concerned with getting data between Model and View.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="solid">SOLID&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#solid">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SOLID are five principles of object oriented programming and design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>S&lt;/strong> is for Single Responsibility Principle. A class or piece of code should be responsible for doing one thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple2_71060858.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>O&lt;/strong> is for Open/Closed Principle. Code should be open for extensions but closed for modifications. Often this refers to the way you can implement an interface and add extra functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ocp.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>L&lt;/strong> is for Liskov Substitution Principle. Objects in a program can be replaced with subtypes of that object with out changing functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/LiskovSubtitutionPrinciple_52BB5162.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I&lt;/strong> is for Interface Segregation Principle. Large interfaces should be split down into small interfaces so that clients only know about methods that are of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/isp.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>D&lt;/strong> is for Dependency Inversion Principle. High and Low level modules should depend on abstractions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dip.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I need to look into SOLID some more but here are some &lt;a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/703634/SOLID-architecture-principles-using-simple-Csharp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">examples&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dry">DRY&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#dry">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>DRY is simply Don’t Repeat Yourself. It is often easy to spot when a function call will help you not have to use the same bit of code in different places. I am often spotting places where I can put this into action.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Test Driven Development or TDD</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/test-driven-development-tdd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/test-driven-development-tdd/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks back I attended a talk at &lt;a href="http://www.agileyorkshire.org/event-announcements/tuesfebruary21st-drolivershawtestdrivendevelopmentthemostmisusedterminsoftwaredevelopmentandkeithwilliamsdependenciesinjectionandabstractionforfunandprofit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile Yorkshire&lt;/a>
about Test Driven Development or TDD by Dr Oliver Shaw. I was impressed at how easy Oliver made it look, so as I have never tried it I thought I should give it a try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tdd_flow.gif?resize=287%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Test Driven Development or TDD is a way of development which starts with writing a Unit Test. First you write a failing test, then you write the code to make it pass, then you refactor your code. This can be remembered by thinking of &lt;strong>Red, Green, Refactor&lt;/strong>. Red being the failing test, Green being getting the test to pass, and Refactor being the refactoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the demonstration Oliver used a language called scala and a system that automatically reran all the tests after every change. I code with Visual Studio in C# is there a way I can get my tests to run automatically as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit of googling and configuring I can answer this as Yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nuget package called &lt;a href="https://testergiles.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giles&lt;/a>
is a watcher which will rerun your tests similar to how Oliver did it with his scalar environment. Fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer will get the joke of why a watcher is called Giles. I couldn’t get this to work with MSTest but works fine with NUnit. There is a powershell script giles.ps1 which you need to run and will update every so often with how many tests have passed or failed. However you may not see this if you are coding in Visual Studio but there is a way to get a notification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you install the application &lt;a href="http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growl&lt;/a>
you can get notifications from Giles which pop up and then disappear. So whatever you have on screen you can find out almost instantly if you have broken tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that I wanted to configure is a way of viewing code coverage and which methods are tested and which aren’t. If you are familiar with VSTS after a build it gives you a percentage score for test coverage. I don’t find this overly useful as it doesn’t tell you what is covered and what isn’t. Also what if you want to use Github, how do you calculate the code coverage then?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nuget packages &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenCover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenCover&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReportGenerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReportGenerator&lt;/a>
allow a html report of code coverage to be produced. I created a batch script that can be run whenever you require this information.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>[path]\OpenCover.Console.exe -target:&amp;#34;[path]\nunit3-console.exe&amp;#34; -targetargs:&amp;#34;[path]\Test.dll&amp;#34; -output:&amp;#34;[path]\coverage.xml&amp;#34; -register:user
[path]\ReportGenerator.exe &amp;#34;-reports:[path]\coverage.xml&amp;#34; &amp;#34;-targetdir:[path]&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The commands are fairly straightforward, the only tricky bit is sorting out all the filepaths to the different programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have all this plumbing setup time to give TDD a try and see what I can build.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Github Vs Bitbucket Vs Visual Studio Team Services</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-vsts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-vsts/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a developer using source control and git is bread and butter of what we do. Github is probably the most popular and widely known hosting service for source control but I have also used Bitbucket and Visual Studio Team Services. Lets have a look at each one and what they offer. Note while I have included prices I have only tried out the free versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="github">Github&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#github">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/github-octocat.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>URL: &lt;a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Private Repositories: Not Available for free&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public Repositories: Unlimited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Team Size: Unlimited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prices: $7 per month for unlimited private repositories, $25 per month for 5 users then $9 per month per user&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is probably the most widely used service for hosting code. Over 13 million repositories of code. This is an ideal solution if you want your code to be publicly viewable, but take care not to publish passwords, private keys or your companies trade secrets. Every developer should have a Github account for displaying bits of code they are proud of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a number of externally built APIs that link into Github for doing extra features, like building, code coverage etc&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bitbucket">Bitbucket&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#bitbucket">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/d8TRzzL.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>URL: &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bitbucket.org/&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Private Repositories: Unlimited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public Repositories: Unlimited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Team Size: Less than 5&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prices: $10 per month for 10 Users, $100 per month for 100 Users, $200 per month for Unlimited Users&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At my last job we used Bitbucket extensively for all our projects. All the code was private so only the team could access it, however before I left we were approaching the 5 user limit (but looking at these prices cost seems very reasonable)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Visual Studio Team Services or VSTS is Microsoft’s version control solution and I have only just started using it, however what I have seen I like. There are lots of options for building your code so VSTS is more than just hosting your code it is verging on a Continuous Integration/Delivery solution. Being a Microsoft product there are numerous links to Azure and it is easy to deploy stuff to that platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All three have options for tracking issues but VSTS have options to add Stakeholder users which would allow none developers to add and keep track of issues and progress with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I want to run tests, look at code coverage VSTS is probably the solution I would go for, if I want something that is public I would go for Github. What do you think which of these is your favourite?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning R</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/learning-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/learning-r/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="R" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Exchange-Rate-Calculator.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
Today I spent some time learning the R language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem I was trying to solve was to convert local prices of some items into Euros. I had been using a fixed exchange rate for all data, but as exchange rates fluctuate so much this is incorrect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first though was to find a free API that I could query to get the values I wanted. The first API I found didn’t cover all the currencies, the next one I found I burnt through the free allowance in one pass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A colleague of mine mentioned using R to solve this, he sent me some links and I set out to write my first piece of R code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My finished code can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/ExchangeRate/blob/master/script.R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
and I will attempt to explain some of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R defines functions fairly simply&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>nameoffunction &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">function&lt;/span>(arg1, arg2)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> arg1 &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> arg2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have created a function that takes 2 parameters date and currency. I know I have about 10 different currencies that I want to get currencies for and I want to loop through each day so I will need to pass in a date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The source of my exchange rate information is the &lt;a href="https://www.xe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.xe.com&lt;/a>
website, its historical exchange rate page passes currency and date into the query string so I should be able to build up a string containing all the different elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All programming language can concatenate strings and R is no different. R uses paste()&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However R has an annoying feature in this function. I would expect that var in the above example would contain &amp;ldquo;HelloWorld&amp;rdquo;, it doesn’t it contains &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;. Why it automatically adds a space I don’t know?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, sep&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I am not entirely sure what all of the code does but I can take a good guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>read_html() I would guess loads a html page, html_nodes() finds all the html tags of a certain type on the page, in my case &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;, html_table() reads the first table it finds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>table1[2] selects the second column, and head() selects a specific number of rows. I want the first row and second column so I combine these two as head(table1[2],1)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have found my exchange rate what do I do with it? R can read and write to SQL Server so why not store this info in a SQL lookup table. I can then use this data in a stored procedure when I process my data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To query sql you can use sqlQuery(), it has two parameters, a sql connection and a TSQL command (eg a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE statement)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use a while loop to loop through every day between 1st October 2016 and today and look up the exchange rate for each currency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now I am manually running this R script, however there are ways to run R directly from SQL Server which I may well investigate. I could then have a SQL job to run this on a schedule, maybe once a day to get the latest exchange rates. I also would like to do something a bit cleverer like only getting exchange rates for the days that I need them by querying existing database tables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Side Project – Connect 4</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/side-project-connect-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/side-project-connect-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have probably like me almost forgotten about this blog. Life has got in the way over the last few months, but lets see if I can restart my blogging habit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Connect4.png?w=639&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2017 I want to start a side project for a few reasons. I want to improve my coding skills and look at things I wouldn’t normally during my day job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been trying to decide what to build. The actual project doesn’t matter too much, it is the techniques I use during build that matters the most. I would like something that I can start off as a windows app and then extend onto the web or mobile apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started off thinking about a Rubik’s cube app, however my initial coding has lead me to believe it is probably too complex for my first app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year I spent an evening looking at Connect 4 during a &lt;a href="https://yorkcodedojo.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">York Code Dojo&lt;/a>
session. I think this should be complex enough that I can code some logic to efficiently solve the game, however not too complex I get defeated before building too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I have built a console app that displays via Console.Write() commands, a grid to represent the game, with 0 meaning empty, 1 red and 2 yellow etc. I am currently working on the logic to solve the game, once I have that in a good state I can extend into a winforms app, into a web (MVC most likely) app and finally a mobile app (I have no knowledge about how to do this yet, but something I would like to try one day).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the last few days I listened to .NetRocks where they discussed &lt;a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progressive Web Apps&lt;/a>
. This sounds like a great challenge for me to aim for. A progressive Web App is a website that automatically detects various properties to give you an app that runs well whatever the state of your internet connection and whatever browser you are in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have lots to learn but I can split it down into small sections and I can build something that demonstrates some of my skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What should be in Source Control?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/what-should-be-in-source-control/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/what-should-be-in-source-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am currently working on source code that is over 5Gb in size. This is mostly due to a poorly thought out folder structure, there are code files, images and Excel files all jumbled together. I think a clear distinction should be made between source code and data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="source-code">Source Code&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#source-code">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I will define source code as anything that is written in order to compile and run the project. If it is a webpage it will be all the HTML, CSS and Javascript or any file used to produce these. I would also include any configuration files and files used to build/deploy the website or project. Anything that is compiled from your source files can safely be ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="data">Data&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#data">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I would define data as anything that is added to the project during its life. So if you have an upload option, anything that is uploaded I would describe as data. The site should still function without (or very little) data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="images">Images&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#images">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Images can fit into both groups. Any icons or images attached to the functionality of the project I would class as source code. However anything that is uploaded should be classed as Data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="databases">Databases&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#databases">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The database should also be classed as both. The data, anything that is inside a database table should normally be classed as data. Stored Procedures, Functions and Views are all Source Code and would benefit from version control.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="source-control--backup">Source Control != Backup&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#source-control--backup">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Source control is not an excuse not to backup things. Don’t just commit files to source control so you know you can restore them if you need to. Files in general in source control are there so you can see how they changed over time as the code base changed. Files in you backup are a snapshot of what the application was at a point in time and will include ALL the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last point before I end. If you are hosting on a Cloud Computing platform like Azure it gives you an easy way to distinguish between Data and Code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anything in your&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Web App = Code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blob Storage = Data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SQL = Data/Code&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each project is unique and there will always be exceptions to these suggestions but I think this is a good goal to have. What do you think?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting control of a codebase</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/getting-control-of-a-codebase/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/getting-control-of-a-codebase/</guid><description>&lt;p>So recently I started working on a new codebase. I will be honest when I first saw it, it was a mess. Here are a few of the things I did to try and regain control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was given access to the source code on Visual Studio Team Services. However this consisted of a single commit 3 months ago. When I looked at what was running on the production server it was clear that changes were being made live with no regard for source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I did was commit everything that was running live into source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I created a SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) project to keep track of all the database objects. Previously there was a folder with some stored procedures in it, but these did not match with what was currently running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sql-server-2012-management-studio-splash-screen.png?resize=300%2C204&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I now had in source control the current state of the website and the database, so I knew I could get things back to this state if I made some bad changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start by looking at the website code I had. There was no solution file, the only way to look at the website was to setup my local IIS to run what was in the website folder. I could then use Visual Studio to &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; my local IIS website and attach to process to debug it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I Looked at Default.aspx to see how the website worked. The majority of the website code was stored in the database stored procedures. After the tag there was a &amp;lt;% %&amp;gt; which contained a Response.Write(RunSP.RunStoredProcedure(Parameter1, Parameter2, &amp;hellip;) command, which executed a stored procedure and the results of the stored procedure was the html code including any javascript that the webpage needed to display. I will be honest I have never seen any code like it. My guess is that the developer was secretly a DBA and wanted to make any web page changes by just changing how the stored procedures work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This meant that the website is not going to do anything without a backup of the database running, and meant my SSDT project was going to be vital. However the database was in a bad state, it consisted of a fair few broken objects and SSDT would not build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using find I went through each of the broken database objects to find where in the code they were being used. Luckily most were referenced in commented out code, so I just removed all the broken database objects. The database could now be built. However there was a dependency on the users table of another database. (This was the developers solution to sharing logins between websites) As I was using SSDT I added a database dependency, problem solved for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I tried publishing my database. SQL CMD encountered a parsing error. The reason for this was my SPs contained javascript eg $(document), SQL CMD uses $(DatabaseName) as variables for different database so it was getting itself confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My solution was to use Find and Replace to replace all the $ with &amp;rsquo; + CHAR(36) + '&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I now have a SSDT project that builds and publishes but still no website project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get the website running from Visual Studio I started off creating a .Net 4 website project and added Entity Framework 5 and MVC 3 via nuget. I then copied all the website code into the new project, and with a bit of work I got it to build. Most of the work was relating to namespaces and referencing the correct one and moving the EF model from AppCode to a custom named folder. A bit of trial and error later I had a version of the website that could be run from Visual Studio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have not deployed my new version of the website as it needs further testing. No automated testing or even a smoke test checklist currently exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Visual-Studio-Team-Services.png?w=960&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As my source code is hosted on Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), I can get VSTS to build each commit and check I haven’t broken the build. This is not that helpful at the moment, hopefully one day I will have automated tests that can be run here as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow, I feel like I have done loads with this code so far but there is loads more still to do. I need to understand more about the business processes behind the code with a hope to understand why some architectural decisions have been made. I want to refactor the code as much as is possible, I would like to remove much of the html/javascript from the stored procedures as I can’t see that there is any advantage to running a website like this. Please correct my if I am wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LINQ</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/linq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/linq/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/step30.jpg?w=515&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

&lt;h3 id="what-is-linq">What is LINQ?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-is-linq">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>LINQ&lt;/strong> is an acronym for Language Integrated Query, which describes where it’s used and what it does. The Language Integrated part means that LINQ is part of programming language syntax. In particular, both C# and VB are languages that ship with .NET and have LINQ capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-linq-in-my-c-code">How do I use LINQ in my C# code?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-do-i-use-linq-in-my-c-code">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To use LINQ the first thing you need to do is add the LINQ using statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System.Linq;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In your code you need a datasource, for this example I am going to use a simple array, but it can be anything eg SQL, XML etc&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span>[] data = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span>[&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">10&lt;/span>] { &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">3&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">5&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">6&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">7&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">8&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">9&lt;/span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next you need a LINQ query. (Note I know the Q in LINQ means query, so I have just written query query, if you are one of those people who hates seeing PIN number you might not like this blog post.) A LINQ query is very similar to a T-SQL query, so if like me you are good with databases this should make sense to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In T-SQL you can have:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT&lt;/span> num
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">data&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">WHERE&lt;/span> num &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In LINQ this becomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> query =
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">from&lt;/span> num &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">in&lt;/span> data
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">where&lt;/span> num == &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">select&lt;/span> num;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finally you need to do something with the query you have written. I am just going to print the results of my query to console.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach&lt;/span> (&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> num &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">in&lt;/span> query)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Console.Write(num);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="what-other-sql-like-syntax-can-i-use">What other SQL like syntax can I use?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-other-sql-like-syntax-can-i-use">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In T-SQL you can control ordering using ORDER BY, LINQ has a similar syntax orderby&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">orderby&lt;/span> num &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">descending&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In T-SQL you can use GROUP BY, to do something similar with LINQ&lt;/p>

which has loads of examples of different queries that you can write with LINQ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has inspired me to use LINQ more in my code and learn more about the different queries that could be written.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back Ten years</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/looking-back-ten-years/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/looking-back-ten-years/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/10-year-term-life-insurance.gif?resize=471%2C314" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next month I will celebrate ten years working at my current job, two weeks after that I will start a new chapter of my life at a new company. Lets take this opportunity to look back ten years at some of the great stuff I have achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2006">2006&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#2006">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2006 I had no IT experience. If you were to ask me where Event Logs could be found I wouldn’t know, and the letters DNS meant nothing to me. I was quiet and shy but hard working. The idea of making IT my career hadn’t occurred to me, this was just a job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started off life doing first line support and compiling health and safety files onto CD-ROMs (known by the company as Eurofiles) with HTML. At the time the company had a mix of Windows 2000 and Windows XP, using MS Office 2003. Server wise I can’t remember exactly but I think two domain controllers, a database server and a backup server using a tape drive. At this point in time I don’t believe I did a lot with the servers but I think the servers were running Windows Server 2005.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As time went on I learnt more and more about what the company did and how stuff worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="nagios">Nagios&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#nagios">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of my early achievements was setting up a nagios server. I have blogged about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/i-love-nagios/">Nagios&lt;/a>
before, but it is a server monitoring system that runs on linux. I am extremely proud of what I have achieved here, no one else in the company had my knowledge of how nagios worked. Initially I even experimented with using a cheap mobile phone connected to the serial port (remember when PCs had these?) to send SMS messages to alert of down time. However this was abandoned when I burned through all the credit on this phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is still used today, and my current team have been shown how to extend the system as the business changes. My philosophy has always been if we have a problem that Nagios didn’t warn us about we need an extra nagios test. These days the nagios web interface is publicly available on the internet so can be checked from anywhere (assuming the office internet is up!) and a mobile app replaces the SMS idea we originally had.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2011">2011&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#2011">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At the end of 2010 the IT Manager resigned, then the Developer resigned and finally the Lead Developer resigned. I was alone. I was IT Manager. I negotiated my first pay rise since joining the company. I was IT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow things were stressful back then. I had so much to learn but somehow I managed. I learnt how to Interview, yes I have employed some clangers along the way, but also some great staff. As well as internal staff I learnt to deal with contractors. We had contractors to help with our internal systems and also contractors to do development work. One thing I have learnt about contractors is that you will always have to chase them at some point to deliver what you are paying them for.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="server-migration">Server Migration&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#server-migration">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Around the start of 2011 our email server started to show its age. Exchange 2003 had a hard limit on the size of its information store and we were rapidly approaching this. Along with an IT contractor I worked to migrate to Exchange 2010, this was a huge project and caused all sorts of issues which we just worked through. Since then I have done other migrations so Windows Server 2012 and also virtualized many servers in 2013.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#bandwidth">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A major limit with our infrastructure has always been the internet connection coming in. For a while we tried to load balance three ADSL connections, but the upload speed was always a limiting factor. It was a major victory for the simplification of our network when we got a leased line installed into our head office, helped by a government grant we gave us free installation. Not content with this I did the same again for our second York office, including the free installation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="learning-development">Learning Development&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#learning-development">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since I started I have always been learning development stuff. But in the past few years I have learnt a massive amount helped largely by two main things. My boss passing lots of my responsibility onto others and dedicating lots of my time to development tasks, and also the opportunity to learn with our outsourced development team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="finishing-off">Finishing off&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#finishing-off">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a few things that have been ongoing that we have wanted to change since I started which I can’t really take the credit for as they are not complete yet, but I am proud as they may be finished in the next few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company stores calendar information in one giant excel spreadsheet, this is being replaced by outlook calendars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our last Windows Server 2003 server and tape drive is being decommissioned. This is the only server that has been running for the entire time I have been here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way the company keeps track of work coming in and who does what is being reviewed. Over the years many people have tried to adapt the old database that one of the directors created in Access many years ago. I did a major overhaul recently to delete unused columns and added extra invoicing functionality. What is needed is a fresh system, maybe a CRM can do everything they want. I wish them lots of luck in doing this as I know it won’t be easy but it has to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2016">2016&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#2016">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are many other projects and pieces of work that I have done that I am proud of. In 2016 I will leave a stable IT department. All clients are on Windows 10 and using Office 2010. We have virtual servers running Server 2012 and are using some great services from Azure to run our SaaS websites. There are of course things I would have liked to achieve, and things I wish I had done differently but on the whole it feels like the right time to move on, especially now long running projects are starting to conclude.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>10 Ways to Survive as an IT Manager</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/10-ways-to-survive-as-an-it-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/10-ways-to-survive-as-an-it-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>So after five and a bit years of being an IT Manager here is some advice I have learned along the way in no particular order. On the whole I have enjoyed myself but it has been a real challenge at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-figure-out-what-plates-are-still-spinning">1. Figure out what plates are still spinning&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#1-figure-out-what-plates-are-still-spinning">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Being an IT Manager is all about keeping everything running all of the time. A bit like spinning 5 or 6 plates. You have plates for your servers and network infrastructure, you have plates for bespoke databases that you maintain, you have plates for your staff (including any external contractors), you have plates for any websites or apps that you develop. That is a lot of plates to keep spinning and that before you start thinking about what your boss wants you to deliver. Make sure you know what is happening with all these plates, which ones are happy, which ones are on the way to the floor and which ones you need to get the glue out and repair.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-make-it-someone-elses-problem">2. Make it someone else’s problem&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#2-make-it-someone-elses-problem">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you can blame someone else do so. If your internet goes down it is your ISPs fault. If your website dies its your hosting company’s fault. Take responsibility for problems but if when something goes wrong you can pick up the phone and ask for help, it will make your life easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3-hire-good-staff">3. Hire good staff&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#3-hire-good-staff">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hiring poor staff wastes time and money and makes you look bad by others. Demand the highest salary band for new staff that you can afford and don’t agree to hiring anyone that you have doubts about. It is easy to bow to the pressure to get someone quickly but this will always result in worse problems in the long run. Once you have a good team do your best to keep them, and warn upper management of the problems if staff leaves (basically make it their problem not yours!).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="4-learn-learn-learn">4. Learn, Learn, Learn&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#4-learn-learn-learn">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You may or may not have the opportunity to go on training courses. Whatever your situation spend time learning new stuff that will benefit the company and yourself. You can learn a lot by reading online, you can petition for training from your managers, you can fund training yourself, you can ask for help from your different suppliers. The more you learn, the more you can do and the more useful you can be to the company, plus the more interesting you will find the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="5-say-no">5. Say No!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#5-say-no">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Don’t be afraid to say no. You will always be asked to do the impossible and if something is impossible say so at the start. It wastes everyone’s time if you spend a lot of time trying to do the impossible. Always give your reasons for saying no, and if you always say no people will think you are unhelpful. A better way to say no is to come up with a better solution. No I can’t do it your way but here is a better solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="6-dont-give-estimates">6. Don’t give estimates&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#6-dont-give-estimates">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are asked how long something will take you don’t answer straight away or give an exaggerated estimate. Go away and spend some time thinking of everything that is involved before replying. There will always be something that you forgot to consider when first asked about it and looking at the different components will help plan out the work needed as well as provide an estimate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="7-know-what-to-tell-your-boss-and-what-not-to">7. Know what to tell your boss, and what not to&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#7-know-what-to-tell-your-boss-and-what-not-to">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a hard one to get the balance right for. You need to tell your boss enough so that they appreciate all that you do, but too much and they will stop listening and accuse you of talking in technobabble. I have never got the balance right with this one. I have always aired on the side of not telling my boss enough, and hence they don’t realize that I saved the day on Sunday night as everything is working again on Monday. Do repeat yourself. If your server is running low on resources start asking for replacement hardware early, and increase the frequency and the panic in line with the problems it is causing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="8-understand-the-problems-of-the-business">8. Understand the problems of the business&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#8-understand-the-problems-of-the-business">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bhrzpww6aehdx1wvrrug.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses need to make money. If the one you work for isn’t making enough money you will soon be looking for another. If you work for IT you will quickly start to see the problems of the business, think about what simple changes IT could make to improve things that would benefit the whole company. Some of your suggestions won’t go anywhere, but some may have a massive impact. I can think of a few changes that IT have spearheaded that I am very proud of, upgrading our internet connection, simplifying or automating processes and delivering new versions of software.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="9-ask-for-help">9. Ask for help&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#9-ask-for-help">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Don’t be afraid of asking for help. There are lots of places to look for help. Other departments could take more on, you could recruit extra help, you could hire external contractors. You can ask questions on support forums like &lt;a href="https://serverfault.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServerFault&lt;/a>
or &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow&lt;/a>
, many software re-sellers or other suppliers are a good point of contact for questions about things they supply. Microsoft Support was also invaluable for a server issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="10-think-about-disasters">10. Think about disasters&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#10-think-about-disasters">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Write a disaster recovery plan or backup policy. Yes there will always be something more important that needs doing, but just stop for a moment to think how you would feel if everything died on your watch. The one thing you can rely on with technology is that it will fail at some point. A back of the envelope plan of action is better than no plan at all, even better is a detailed plan of what to do when each and every service you rely on fails. Plan additional services with an idea of adding extra redundancy. Always have multiple Domain Controllers, think about what data you could run from the Cloud. VMs could be replicated to the Cloud, and servers could be run from there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Imposter Syndrome</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/imposter-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/imposter-syndrome/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week I handed in my notice at a job I have had for almost ten years. In a few weeks time I will start a brand new job as a web applications developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a great achievement for me and a great chance to learn and expand my development skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However moments after I handed my notice in, a huge wave of uncertainty enveloped me. I have read about this and I think I was suffering from an attack of &lt;strong>Imposter Syndrome&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1429677066685.rendition-medium.jpg?w=598&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started to convince myself I couldn’t do the job I had just accepted and that moments after I arrived on my first day I would be found out as a fraud and kicked out the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My logical brain was no match for the Imposter Syndrome. Having been kicked out the door of this new job, I would become penniless in no time with no employer (even my previous boss wouldn’t want me back) or recruitment agency willing to speak with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK lets see if we can fight off the Imposter Syndrome and look at a possible worse case scenario. I start at my new job, it is very hard work and a month or so later I have to move on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No employer ever would sack me on my first day. My first day will be lots of learning how they do things, looking at procedures. I have lots of experience of learning new things, looking at procedures and if I put the work in I can make this new job a success. I have lots of good ideas and useful experience that no one at my new company has.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know what the solution is to Imposter Syndrome other than to try and ignore it by thinking positively and the knowledge that I have done amazing things in the last ten years and I will do the same in the next ten.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DZone</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/dzone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/dzone/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while now I have been sharing some of my blog posts on the &lt;a href="https://dzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dzone&lt;/a>

&lt;p>The Dzone website allows users to submit links to content and I have been submitting the content I have created on this website. This is how Dzone describes themselves:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With over 1 Million members, DZone.com is one of the web’s largest communities and publishers of technical content for software professionals. Developers from all over the world come to DZone for the latest and best content to hone their skills and advance their careers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well this week I have been invited to join the &lt;a href="https://dzone.com/pages/mvb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVB&lt;/a>
(Most Valuable Blogger) programme. The hope is that more of my readers will find my content from the DZone website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DZone team will soon start sharing my content on the DZone website and I hope this will result in even more people reading what I have to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If nothing else this is clearly telling me that my blog is making a difference, people are taking note of me and what I have to say. I need to keep going and keep writing articles and be more consistent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon Web Services Pt 2</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services-pt-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services-pt-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last time I started looking at Amazon Web Services and how it differed from Azure. I am going to continue looking at what it can do.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#virtual-machines">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lets look at what you can do with Virtual Machines. I selected to create a new Virtual Machine (or as AWS calls them an EC2 Instance)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you choose a name for your VM and then the OS that runs on it. There are 5 main OSes to choose from Windows Server, Amazon Linux and a selection of the most common Linux flavours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can then download a certificate to secure your VM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like Azure, AWS takes a few moments to create your VM. While I wait I can see that AWS has configured a firewall so only my current IP can connect to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the VM is ready you can download an RDP file. However to get the login details you need to decrypt the password using the certificate you downloaded when you created the VM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is interesting to compare the difference in security between Azure and AWS. Azure allows the resetting of passwords of VMs directly from its console, however I suspect that in AWS if you loose your certificate (AWS states they don’t keep a copy of this) you would have to recreate your VM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like with the Websites the default name of the VM is much less user-friendly than what you get from Azure. However I suspect there are other options I haven’t spotted that may customise these.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="azure-portal-vs-aws-console">Azure Portal vs AWS Console&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#azure-portal-vs-aws-console">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I really like the Azure Portal. It feels like something that has been designed so you can easily access all the options for a specific Azure feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AWS Console probably has all the same options as with Azure however I don’t think it looks half as good, and will take me a while looking through menus to find the equivalent options. Part of this is due to my unfamiliarity with AWS, so will get easier with time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon Web Services</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a big fan of Azure but I know zero about its biggest rival – Amazon Web Services or AWS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So lets sign up for a free trial and see what it can do. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Amazon Web Services" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aws-300x169.png?resize=300%2C169" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AWS free trial is available from &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/free/&lt;/a>
and lasts for 12 months. From memory I think the Azure free trial lasted only one month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start you need to login with your amazon account and create an AWS account. This requires your name and address and your payment info (you will only get billed if use services not covered by your free trial).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly AWS requires you to verify your identity via an automated phone call. (I don’t recall doing anything like this for Azure but please correct me if I am wrong.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are logged in you get a series of links displaying all the different services that are available. First impression is this is a simpler view to Azure’s portal with a similar amount of services. At the top right is an option to select which region you want to use, in Azure I use North Europe and West Europe, AWS has Ireland and Frankfurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-web-app">Create a Web App&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#create-a-web-app">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First thing to try is setting up a website. I selected create a web app and I get a page asking me for its basic details (very similar to Azure, however AWS asked what language your code is written in, Azure handles all of these) AWS websites appear to support a host of different options similar to Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The actual creation of your website takes a few moments (like on Azure). However the default URL for websites is similar to &lt;a href="http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/&lt;/a>
which is not quite as nice as the Azure equivalent &lt;a href="http://test.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.azurewebsites.net&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure has a host of command lines available via powershell. AWS has a similar command line interface called AWS CLI, including the option to deploy from git to your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is an extension that allows for the publishing of websites to AWS. (Just like you can publish to Azure)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I learn more about AWS I will continue to blog about it. &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/08/04/amazon-web-services-pt-2/">Amazon Web Services Pt 2&lt;/a>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wrong, Wrong, Wrong!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few clever things I have been able to script to make developing with it passable. I still would rather use Visual Studio but this improves the experience a fair bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="source-control">Source Control&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#source-control">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Access files are binary (I use the ADP/ADE file format but I assume other Access file formats have the same problem) and so you can’t diff them to see what has changed. This is bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However there is a solution to this. A tool called Access SVN and can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://accesssvn.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://accesssvn.codeplex.com/&lt;/a>
, this gives you a way to extract to text files all the forms and reports that are in Access. Before every commit I would manually run this tool on my ADP file and extract to text files, then I would commit these text files to source control and could easily see what had changed in each commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the name Access SVN, the tool is not tied to subversion, you can use any source control system, I use git.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also included in this tool is a way to do this with the command line, so you can make this a build step on your build server. I have not used this extensively yet, but the syntax is fairly simple&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>asvn.exe e &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;path to Access file&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;path to txt files&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;*.*&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The filter at the end &lt;em>.&lt;/em> allows you to specify what to extract so you could extract all forms/reports beginning with D with &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>.D&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;. I had trouble using &lt;em>.&lt;/em> because the names of my forms/reports contain characters not allowed in a windows file name. I am sure there is a way round this but I haven’t had chance to look into it further yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="testing-ms-access">Testing MS Access&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#testing-ms-access">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Surely testing is not possible with MS Access? I would have agreed with that statement the other day until I found a neat way of testing if a feature is enabled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly a bit of background. I develop using MS Access 2003 because the design view is far easier to use, however because it is out of support all my users use MS Access 2010. MS Access 2010 has a feature called Tabbed Documents which allows all forms and reports to open in new tabs so you can easily switch between them. This feature can only be enabled in MS Access 2010 and has no effect if opening with MS Access 2003.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use Access SVN on your Access file with tabbed documents turned on and off you will see UseMDIMode: 0 and UseMDIMode: 1 show up in the Database properties file. UseMDIMode: 0 means that tabbed documents is turned on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In powershell I can now write a test to see if UseMDIMode: 0 can be found in the database properties file&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Get-Content &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;General\Database properties.dbp.txt&amp;#34;&lt;/span> | Select-String &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;UseMDIMode: 0&amp;#34;&lt;/span> -quiet
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If the test passes True will be returned, if it fails null will be returned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my build server I scripted the extraction of Database properties.dbp.txt from the ADP file with asvn.exe before running this test. While not strictly needed as Database properties.dbp.txt should be in source control, it is possible that someone could forget to extract the text files from the ADP, with this step you are always testing what is enabled in the binary file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ms-access-connection-strings">MS Access Connection Strings&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#ms-access-connection-strings">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While developing with MS Access I often swap the database connection to point to my local machine or a build server. I always try and remember to only ever commit with this set to the live database to avoid obvious problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other day I found on &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16411430/change-access-server-connection-from-command-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow&lt;/a>
a way to script this. I love this! I can include this step in my deployment process and it will overwrite what ever the connection string is in source control with what your production environment needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All you need to run this step is, (note it is spaces between the parameters not commas)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cscript connect.vbs Project.adp &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;ServerName&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;DatabaseName&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The contents of connect.vbs can be found on the &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16411430/change-access-server-connection-from-command-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow article&lt;/a>
. It is also possible to pass username and password if your environment requires this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="compiled-ade">Compiled ADE&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#compiled-ade">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The last clever thing I do with MS Access is convert my ADP file into the compiled ADE version. To manually do this there is an option in the tools menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To automate this I run&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>cscript createADE.vbs &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;path to ADP&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;path to ADE&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The contents of createADE came from this &lt;a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/01fd48a9-258e-4405-86f1-adfb2f1057ee/create-an-access-2007-ade-from-a-adp-via-commandline?forum=accessdev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum post&lt;/a>
, the only change I made was to comment out some of the echo statements so it would run silently as part of my build process. It should be noted that cscript and wscript are almost identical and either will run these scripts however in a command line environment cscript is preferable, and wscript should be used in a windows environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am quite surprised at how much I have managed to do in terms of scripting the build and deployment process for MS Access. I still don’t like developing with Access but this has definitely improved things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Periodic Table of DevOps</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/periodic-table-devops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/periodic-table-devops/</guid><description>&lt;p>The periodic table lists all the chemical elements and groups them together based on some key properties. Today I found an article about the &lt;a href="https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">periodic table of DevOps&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/https-xebialabs.com-assets-files-infographics-periodic-table-of-devops-v2.png?resize=1024%2C572&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not going to discuss every element but I thought I might go through some that I have heard of or used.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Github – The repository of lots of open source software. My Github can be found at &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/funkysi1701&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amazon Web Services – The second most popular cloud computing provider (not sure why this isn’t number 3?)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Git – The distributed source control system that everyone uses these days.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Azure – The number one cloud provider, I have used this a lot, mostly with websites but also with some of their other features like Traffic Manager.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bitbucket – like Github but allows private repositories. I have used this extensively for work based projects that I don’t want to be public.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google Cloud Platform – don’t know much about this one, but no surprise that google wants a piece of the cloud computing pie.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Selenium – This is a product I want to play about with as allows front end testing with a browser.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rackspace – Before we made the jump to Azure we made use of some Rackspace servers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subversion – The first source control system that I used, but been using git so long now not sure I can remember how it worked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visual Studio – The IDE from Microsoft that I use to write code. I am a big fan as it does everything I could want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>TeamCity – The continuous integration software that I have been using to automate my deployments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MSBuild – This is used by Visual Studio to build your software and can also be used by your deployment scripts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trello – A website that allows you to create a board of ideas or things to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Slack – Brings all your communication together in one place. It’s real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New Relic – A software analytics tool suite used by developers, ops, and software companies to understand how your applications are performing. Useful but find myself favouring Application Insights (part of Azure) more now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nagios – Yay nagios is on the list! My favourite server monitoring system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Splunk – This application can be used to search, monitor and analyse all your log files to find out what is happening. Don’t currently use it but I have tried it out in the past.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

For a while now I have been manually tagging my code whenever I do a release, so I can easily work out what has changed by doing a diff between two tags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I am automating my release process with TeamCity I am thinking about how to manage my tags better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TeamCity has a setting called VCS Labeling which comes in very handy.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Untitled.jpg?w=1595&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Configuring it is fairly simple as it only has three settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>VCS root to label&lt;/strong>: This is obviously the url to your git repository
&lt;strong>Labeling pattern&lt;/strong>: This is the text of the label to be added.
&lt;strong>Label successful builds only&lt;/strong>: Do you really want to add a tag if the build failed?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A tag needs to have a unique name, so adding a tag just called &lt;strong>deployed&lt;/strong> won’t work. When I used to add tags manually I used the naming convention of &lt;strong>deployedyyyymmdd&lt;/strong>. While this naming convention is possible with TeamCity I use something a bit more complex to provide more information about what has been deployed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TeamCity provides lots of parameters that can be used in your build steps and also in the Labeling pattern box. I started off using &lt;strong>deployed-build-%system.build.number%&lt;/strong> as my tag which just marks git with the TeamCity build number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I run a TeamCity deployment I don’t always use the same configuration options, I deploy locally, to a test server or to production and sometimes I just deploy the frontend or the backend. How cool would it be to include this information in the tag text?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well the next step was to change my Labeling pattern to &lt;strong>deployed-build-%system.build.number%-%ServerName%-%DatabaseName%-%FrontEndPath%&lt;/strong>, this adds the backend database config settings and the path the frontend was deployed to. Now when looking at git you can see commits marked with multiple tags, one for each deployment that succeeded and the tag will indicate the settings used during that deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I will never forget to add the tag after a release as the adding of a tag is part of the deployment process, if the deployment fails the tag won’t be added. I can test my deployment to test and git will show if this has been successful, and when I deploy live this will also show up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you use tags? Do you mark successful builds with a tag? Why not let me know or leave a comment below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running Windows on Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/windows-10-raspberry-pi-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/windows-10-raspberry-pi-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year you may remember me talking about playing with a Raspberry Pi. Well since then my Raspberry Pi has been sat on a desk collecting dust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week I attended Leeds Sharp and the topic was &lt;strong>Running Windows on Raspberry Pi&lt;/strong> and this has inspired me again to do something with a Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But first what did I learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are a couple more of pics of last nights &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeedsSharp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LeedsSharp&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/QvlsYjNFvB">https://t.co/QvlsYjNFvB&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RaspberryPi?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RaspberryPi&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSIoT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MSIoT&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/60o4wiiPSv">pic.twitter.com/60o4wiiPSv&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Richard Tasker 🇬🇧 (@ritasker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ritasker/status/725970415189909504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2016&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>I had heard that a cut down version of Windows 10 could be installed on the newer Raspberry Pi’s, but I hadn’t really understood how cut down the version of windows is. Having now seen it demonstrated the OS consists of a single page with a few menu options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real power of Windows 10 IoT is when you connect remotely to it. There are a couple of ways to do this, PowerShell (check out &lt;a href="https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm&lt;/a>
for a few commands), and of course connecting Visual Studio to your Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I had previously played with a Pi, it had been with bash scripts and linux commands. The beauty of installing Windows IoT is that you can write c# code, something I do in my day job so theoretically I should find it easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The demonstration at Leeds Sharp was pretty impressive. If you are a fan of the Big Bang Theory you may recall Sheldon playing a Theremin. Well it is actually possible to construct a Theremin from a couple of sensors and a Raspberry Pi. The code for which is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritasker/IoTDemos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have been inspired what shall I do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Raspberry Pi won’t support Windows 10 IoT, so I need to buy the latest version. I am thinking of buying a kit so I can play about with a breadboard, LEDs and resistors. Maybe not build a robot straight away but certainly try doing something that connects to the GPIO pins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any suggestions leave a comment below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exchange Web Services</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/exchange-web-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/exchange-web-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>Where I work we use a really old fashioned way of recording where in the country employees are: Excel!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For years I have been trying to persuade staff to use calendars in Exchange. Outlook is great for looking at one or two people’s calendars at once but quickly gets unmanageable for looking at ten or more peoples availability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I have started looking into how easy it is to query this information to give a custom view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft provide an API to query exchange information called Exchange Web Services or EWS. I have only used EWS with my Exchange 2010 setup, but the documentation mentions working with Exchange 2007 and older or Exchange online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the basics of what I have tried. Fire up Visual Studio and from nuget install EWS.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Install-Package Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I started off with a simple Console App to see how it all worked, and then extended it to a MVC website. I found querying exchange directly was slow, but it is easy enough to cache information in a database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start you need to create an Exchange Service object, by specifying the version of Exchange you are using.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ExchangeService service = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ExchangeService(ExchangeVersion.Exchange2010);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next you need to pass the URL you are using to access Exchange.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>service.Url = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Uri(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;mail.example.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>To access information from exchange you need to pass some Exchange credentials, ideally a username and password that has access to view all the calendars you want to look at.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>service.Credentials = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> WebCredentials(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;username&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;password&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next pass the email address of the user who owns the calendar you want to look at.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>service.ImpersonatedUserId = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ImpersonatedUserId(ConnectingIdType.SmtpAddress, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;me@example.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>My particular exchange server has a self signed SSL certificate which is not going to be trusted by remote clients. The following line ignores this validation check and makes my program connect.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) =&amp;gt; &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now that we have connected to exchange we just need a few lines to look for events in the calendars.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">// Initialize the calendar folder object with only the folder ID.&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>My website queries a SQL database which I can easily populate with a console app that runs at regular intervals throughout the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a lot more I want to do with this project as this is only the basics of what you can do with Exchange Web Services. So expect more blog posts on this subject as I expand its functionality and learn new ways of doing things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revisiting Team City</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/revisiting-teamcity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/revisiting-teamcity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year I blogged about &lt;a href="http://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/04/01/teamcity/">Team City&lt;/a>
, well I have been looking at it again recently. In that time they have even changed their logo!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start with thinking about what I want my Continuous Integration server to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Check out my code from source control (usually master but all feature branches would be even better)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure specific setting for build&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build my code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build my databases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run any unit tests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Optional) Run deployment to Azure Test/Live site&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There are probably other things I want to achieve but I will start with these six.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Checking out code from source control is something Team City does out of the box, so I can safely say I have done this now. It even monitors a branch for changes and initiates a new check out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Team City allows you to create specific build steps so in theory you can have multiple builds for every variation of settings that you want for your code. I have not tried this yet apart from building with the default config, but I don’t expect it will be too difficult.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have managed to get my code to build with Team City, it took a bit of tweaking the different build steps but wasn’t too difficult. Team City has a visual studio build agent which takes you solution file and does what it needs to. The one problem I have found with this step is that I get errors with my tests if I select a Debug config instead of Release.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Databases are always the problem part of the deployment. So far I have manually deployed my databases but I intend on revisit this step. A &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21555038/how-can-i-execute-sql-scripts-using-teamcity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow&lt;/a>
post suggests that I can run SQL code via Team City in the following way by creating a command line executable:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Command executable: c:&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\P&lt;/span>rogram Files&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\M&lt;/span>icrosoft SQL Server&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\1&lt;/span>00&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\T&lt;/span>ools&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\B&lt;/span>inn&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\s&lt;/span>qlcmd.exe
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Command parameters: -S &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>ServerName&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span> -i &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>PathToSQLScript&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have yet to try this but I am hopefully that it will just work. Dropping a database and restoring a back and then running different SQL scripts is all possible from TSQL, so I should be OK. Watch this space for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Running the unit tests got me stuck for a while. I tried setting it up using VSTest or MSTest neither worked mainly because a config file wasn’t being copied with the test binaries. When I tried using NUnit it just worked. The tests that failed gave me a few config settings to change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have powershell scripts that deploy to Azure websites, I think that these could form the basis of a deployment to Azure. Again the difficult step here may end up being deploying all the different databases to Azure. This is also the riskiest step as I need to connect to live servers which is why I will leave this to last, at the very least I could generate scripts that do a full deployment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That’s it for now. Once I have this all working I will revisit again with details of the database steps as I am expecting a few challenges to overcome. What have you used a CI Server for? Are there other things I want to achieve from a project like this? Why not contact me or leave a comment below&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQL Server Management Studio</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/sql-server-management-studio/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/sql-server-management-studio/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use SQL Server Management Studio all the time for writing queries, getting data and general SQL development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="SQL Server Management Studio" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sql-server-2012-management-studio-splash-screen.png?resize=529%2C360" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have enjoyed seeing the improvements that each new version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) introduced. One great improvement was intellisense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature saves typing and reduces errors by automatically suggesting tables, column names or other database objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common query that I get asked to write is provide a spreadsheet that gives the information that satisfies certain criteria. This is easy to do in SSMS, you can write the query, click execute and the rows that satisfy the criteria are displayed. These rows can then be easily copy/pasted into Excel or other spreadsheets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common data item that gets stored in databases is addresses and addresses often contain line breaks to make the data display better. In the earlier versions of SSMS, when you copied and pasted these line breaks were ignored and the data displayed the same in SSMS as it did in Excel. However in the more recent version, theses line breaks got copied across breaking your spreadsheet and making it hard to see what data corresponded with what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I don’t know if this should be described as introducing a bug or fixing one. I can easily argue both sides. If your data contains a line break and you copy this data it should include the line break in the destination, but if it does that it displays badly in Excel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fix I have been using until recently is to use the following TSQL command in my queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">REPLACE&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">REPLACE&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#f92672">@&lt;/span>str, CHAR(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">13&lt;/span>), &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;), CHAR(10), &amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This command replaces any line breaks with an empty string. Both Char(10) and Char(13) are needed because you can have different types of line breaks. This is great if you are writing the script from scratch but isn’t great if your are running a stored procedure or your query has a lot of columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this is to use Visual Studio to run your SQL query. In Visual Studio you can write and run queries via Server Explorer and the results produced don’t contain line breaks. I have only just discovered this solution, but so far it has worked and is very easy to do, plus as I do most of my development in Visual Studio anyway it saves me having to open SSMS to test my queries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unmanaged Database Deployment</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/unmanaged-database-deployment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/unmanaged-database-deployment/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past few months I have been deploying changes to my companies database every couple of weeks or so. Over a weekend when the database was not being used I would make a backup of the database, load up visual studio, deploy the database changes and copy a couple of front-end files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My weekends and evenings have recently become a bit more precious to me since the arrival of my son James. At suitable times to run the database upgrade I am either, asleep, about to fall asleep or be spending time with James.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This entire deployment can be set to run at a time of my choosing using SQL Server Jobs, (not sure why I never thought of doing this before). I still need to check everything is working after it has run. The job can send me an email if it encounters any problems so I can still ensure the company has the minimum of problems but has more frequent changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="unmanaged-database-deployment">Unmanaged Database Deployment&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#unmanaged-database-deployment">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OK so what do I need to do to set this up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/deploy.jpg?resize=263%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Test all your code changes are working correctly on a backup of the database and everything is committed to source control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Backup everything that is going to be changed so it can be rolled back in case of a problem. I don’t rely on the daily backup jobs for this, I do my own. Maybe I am a bit paranoid, or maybe I am just being cautious.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>BACKUP &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DATABASE&lt;/span> DBName &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">TO&lt;/span> DISK&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;E:\SQL Backups\Filename.bak&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I would include in the backup file name the date and time of the deployment for easy reference later on. For the front-end files these are backed up daily and only ever change during a deployment so I am going to rely on the day to day backups, plus they are in source control so in a worse case scenario I can look there.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>From Visual Studio create a deployment script using the publish option and save as a file on your database server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a SQL Server Job and give it a descriptive name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In steps create a step called backup and enter the T-SQL code above. Set this to stop on failure and continue on success.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a second step called upgrade of type operating system with the following code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>sqlcmd -S (local) -i &amp;#34;E:\SQL Backups\deploy_test.sql&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The -S parameter is the name of your SQL Server instance and the -i parameter is the path to the sql script you generated from Visual Studio above. Set this job to quit reporting success or failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>In schedule create a date time you want the job to run, make sure this is a one time job as you don’t want it to try and run again possibly causing problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In notifications I have set to email on completion, you can set it to email on failure only. I would prefer to know the outcome of the job regardless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using SQL Server jobs to copy files over the network is possible but is not trivial to setup so I am going to use windows task scheduler for this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a job in task scheduler to copy all the ADPs or ADEs that have been changed. If the SQL job fails you will need to copy the old versions of these back but that is simple enough to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This process can be expanded to check code out of source control and do even more automated deployments but for now this is good enough for my purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things to know before working on your database</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/things-to-know-before-working-on-your-databasethings-to-know-before-working-on-your-database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/things-to-know-before-working-on-your-databasethings-to-know-before-working-on-your-database/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently saw this blog &lt;a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/07/questions-to-ask-before-you-touch-a-database-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post&lt;/a>
by &lt;a href="http://www.brentozar.com/team/brent-ozar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Ozar&lt;/a>
that I thought I might discuss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brent listed 13 questions to ask about a database before you start working with it. I am going to go through these 13 questions and expand on them based on my experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is this database in production now?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I think it should go without saying that the first thing you should find out is if your database is in production. If its not in production you can do what you like and no one will notice.
I know what databases are in production and which aren’t where I work so I can answer this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If this goes down, what apps go down with it?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>What apps are running on what databases is a good second question. I have at least one database which has multiple front end apps. At first glance you would think that that these two apps are not connected but they are, I need to be careful with both of these apps to make sure they don’t break each other.
I know what apps run off what databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When those apps go down, is there potential for loss of life or money?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is a difficult question so I will split it into two. Loss of life, my databases don’t control life support machines or nuclear weapons so my first instinct would be to say no. However it is not that straightforward, what if your app allowed contractors to know the location of dangers inside a property they were working in. Once your app goes down, they could have an accident due to lack of information.
Loss of money, this one is more straightforward. Time is money in the business world so any time that your app is down and your employees are not able to work is a loss of money. If your database is linked to an eCommerce site, the loss of money could be extremely high.
I know what affect downtime will have on my users and business.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How sensitive are these apps to temporary slowdowns?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Similar to the previous question, a slowdown can be as serious as downtime for some applications.
Luckily most of my apps are internal only so are not seriously affected by slowness.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful backup?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I manage the backup schedule for all my databases so I know exactly when each one was last backed up. When ever I do anything to a production database I will run a backup so I can roll back in case of problems. As part of developing changes I run my changes on a backup of the data. I can script all my changes and repeatedly run them against a backup until I am sure no problems will occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/uf010206.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful restore test?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>More important than a backup is testing restoring your databases. If you can’t restore data then your backup is useless. I try to test restoring my backups at least weekly so I know that I can rely on my backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is everyone okay losing data back to the last successful backup?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If disaster strikes you could loose all data between now and the time of your last backup. But all is not lost transactional backups can be scheduled throughout the day, in my case the most data we could loose is 15 minutes. This could be configured to be more or less frequent depending on your data. But remember the previous question and make sure you test a restore of your transactional backups, if you can’t restore from them you will be forced to restore from the last successful backup.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="8">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful clean corruption test?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Corruption can be a killer if it is not found quickly. If you need to restore to the last backup before corruption occurred this could result in a significant amount of data loss. To check for corruption you need to run DBCC regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="9">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do we have a development or staging environment where I can test my changes first?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If the answer to this is no, then your next job is to setup a development or staging area. Having a development environment makes development a lot easier and I don’t think I could manage to do all the changes I have done recently without one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="10">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is there any documentation for why the server was configured this way?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I really wish we had more documentation about configurations as it would make finding out why thing were setup the way they are. So unfortunately the answer to this question is No.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="11">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What changes am I not allowed to make?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Depending on what your app does, where it is hosted, how quick the changes are needed and many other factors will all restrict what changes you can make. Historical decisions on the database can also affect what changes can be made, if the database has been structured in a certain way, it may be very difficult to restructure it in a more efficient way.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="12">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who can test that my changes fixed the problem?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is an interesting question, from experience the best people to speak to about problems with the database are the users. If they can show you how to reproduce a problem, you should be able to fix this problem, after that you can probably get them to verify that it has been fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="13">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who can test that the apps still work as designed, and that my changes didn’t have unintended side effects?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is an extension of the previous question. The main users of your app should be your first port of call to find out if the app works as expected. However exploring side affects and undesired features is something that I would test as part of the development process. It has taken a while but I have constructed a detailed check list that can be used for testing so I know that most bugs can be found before release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Source Control Fail</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-control-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-control-fail/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every developer uses source control, it is a great tool for keeping track of changes to your code, seeing who has done what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However I keep messing up, my use of it. I am fairly disciplined when creating new features, all my changes will get committed to source control and when I am happy I will deploy these changes to the live system. But as soon as there is a bug, especially one where the client is chasing for a fix, I will deploy a fix as soon as humanly possible on to the live system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance there is nothing wrong with what I have described but what happens the next time I deploy a new feature. Yes the bug the client was complaining about gets deployed with the new feature as the fix was never committed into source control. The client gets angry as the bug he was screaming about is back again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every change you make to the system &lt;strong>MUST&lt;/strong> be committed to source control. If it isn’t that change will look like it never existed. I have worked with source control for over 5 years why do I keep making this rookie mistake over and over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt has a &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/05/10-commandments-of-good-source-control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
about the 10 commandments of using source control. His number two commandment is “If it’s not in source control, it doesn’t exist” He talks more about code you have written being not saved into source control, but the principal is the same for my example as his.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are ways to automatically deploy from source control, however most of the time you don’t want your live database being rebuilt because you fixed a typo. Additional steps will need to be implemented and there is still the chance that you might want to bypass these steps to fix the urgent problem. The only way past this problem is for you and everyone on your team to be disciplined and only ever commit to source control first, and only after that deploy live (either automatically or manually)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tidying my desktop</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/tidying-my-desktop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/tidying-my-desktop/</guid><description>&lt;p>My desktop is always a mess. I constantly download files there and forget all about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every now and then I copy files into sub directories, so my desktop looks sane for a day or two before it gets out of control again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don’t I write a script that I can schedule to do this for me. Then my desktop will always be tidy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have written a few simple batch scripts, but of course the best scripting language out there at the moment is PowerShell. Lets use that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows provides a nice little utility for writing scripts called the Windows PowerShell ISE, so let&amp;rsquo;s start by loading that up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS has lots of help included to help you, just run &lt;strong>Get-Help [name of ps command]&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To move files you can use &lt;strong>Move-Item&lt;/strong> which works very similar to copy, specify source and destination. In my case I moved files based on their file extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Move-Item *.pdf folder&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all I need to do is schedule this script to run either every day or so, or maybe every time I login or switch my computer on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PowerShell can do lots more interesting things which hopefully I will blog about soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Source Code for Game of Life</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-code-for-game-of-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 09:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-code-for-game-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I blogged about the Game of Life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The file date is November 2004 and the source code has no comments so I don’t know what was going through my head when I wrote it, or even what some of it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To view the source code download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.src_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life.src&lt;/a>
, to download the finished program download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life&lt;/a>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am actually surprised I was expected the code to be much worse than it was, I am not saying it is good, but I can see more than one method and I can’t see any code that obviously is repeated. I can see some terrible variable names. Note to future self don’t use tmp676_674!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming that I wrote this in 2004 what would I have been doing then? It was before I started working in IT. (Hard to imagine I know!) It may even have been before I started living with Keith, before he recruited me for my first IT role. I think I was probably working as an administrator for Defra at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we put 2004 in technical terms, it was before I joined facebook, Office 2003 and XP would have been installed on my PC, and probably felt brand new.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Game of Life</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/game-of-life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2015 09:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/game-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many, many years ago I tried to learn Java. I didn’t get very far but one of the things I built was The Game of Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately I can not find the code I wrote, probably a good things as it is probably amusingly bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you are probably asking what is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game of Life&lt;/a>
? The game of life, sometimes called cellular automation, is a simulation of cells being born and dying. It is sometimes called Conway’s Game of Life after the British mathematician who devised it in 1970.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/Gospers_glider_gun.gif" loading="lazy"
width="250" height="180"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The game has several rules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Any cell with less than three neighbours will die on the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any cell with three neighbours lives on to the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any cell with more than three neighbours will die on the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours will be born on the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now I had not thought about this game until the other day when I came across a &lt;a href="https://chaosnil.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/new-project-conways-game-of-life-in-every-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog&lt;/a>
and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/chaomodus/gameoflife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github page&lt;/a>
which sparked my interest again. This version is written in javascript, but the blog mentions a desire to build this program in many different languages. I want to build this with visual studio in C# as it should provide a good training exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several problems I need to overcome to achieve this, I am currently trying to work out how to &amp;ldquo;draw&amp;rdquo; the cells. My current thinking is that maybe I can code it using characters to display the cells and then replace with pixels once I have the logic correct. Well lots for me to learn!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Great British Code Off</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/great-british-code-off/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/great-british-code-off/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Great British Code Off" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/logo.jpg" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Great British Bake Off and The Great British Sewing Bee are very popular TV shows. Each week the contestants take part in a baking or sewing challenge and the judges choose the best and the worst, with the worst having to leave. This is very entertaining as you watch the drama between the contestants and the reactions as the judges tell them they are rubbish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Could this simple format be applied to computer programming? I think it could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only developers I know argue about the best way of tackling different problems, despite being friends. I am going to assume that this is typical behaviour and not unique to them. So for this TV show, we will split the contestants into pairs, that way we would get the added drama of how well they work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still undecided if the pairs stick together each week with one pair leaving or if we randomize the pairs with one person leaves. The second option would cause there to be a group of three every other week, not sure if this would be a benefit or a curse for that group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friends who are experienced programmers have agreed to be the judges, they both have experience of hiring and firing people, know what to look for in good code, and never agree so should be entertaining enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the bake off the contestants don’t really know how well they have done until the judges cut into their cake and take a bite. For the code off we could not compile the code until the judges run it, would make coding extra difficult as if the contestants are anything like me, I run my code every five minutes to see what affect that change has made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what challenges can we come up with?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Web Design week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stored Procedure week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mobile App week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loops&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Logic problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bugs weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performance issues&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I think we are onto a winner here. What does everyone else think?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Podcasts</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/podcasts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/podcasts/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while now I have been listening to podcasts. For those that don’t know a podcast is an audio file that you can download and listen to, usually about a topic you are interested in. The topics that interest me are obviously Star Trek, Science and Technology and IT stuff. I mainly listen to them in the car when I am driving, but sometimes it will be at home when doing jobs around the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the first podcast I listened to was &lt;a href="http://www.trekmate.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trekmate&lt;/a>
. Trekmate as the name suggests is about Star Trek, it’s a few guys talking about Star Trek. It’s very similar to those conversations you have in the pub with your mates. Trekmate do lots of podcasts, one for almost every flavour of Star Trek out there, I don’t keep up with all of them, but the ones I listen to I really enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favourite podcast that is work related is &lt;a href="http://www.runasradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RunAs Radio&lt;/a>
. If you are a SysAdmin or have an interest in servers or IT you should listen to this. The host Richard Campbell interviews IT experts about a particular piece of technology, one week it will be Exchange, the next Security, and then SQL Server. Often I will learn something that I will want to try out, some weeks I won’t learn something specific but will give be an insight into which way IT for businesses is going. I think it was probably only after listening to RunAs Radio that are started having more of a long term plan for my IT infrastructure at work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I have blogged about before I am learning Development so obviously I listen to &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET Rocks&lt;/a>
. This is hosted by Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell (yes the same guy that does RunAs Radio) who talk to developers about code, learning and IT from a more Developer point of view. This is released 3 times a week so is a bit hit and miss sometimes, but most weeks there will be something relevant to me or worth listening to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago I did something for the first time, I was a guest on one of the Trekmate pods, TenForward. I reviewed 5 Star Trek episodes. This was a bit of a leap for me as an introvert I don’t like to be the center of attention and I certainly don’t like how my voice sounds recorded. Hopefully when released people will like it and I will do lots more of these in the future. Once it has been released I will put a link up here so you can all have a listen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pair Programming</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/pair-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/pair-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I have been working through the challenges on the &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freecodecamp&lt;/a>
website and one of the unique things that this site does is give you the chance to program with another person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am an introvert and if you were to ask me to pick up the phone and ring someone I will procrastinate a lot before doing it (if I do it at all), I also am not good at speaking with strangers but I have been enjoying the pair programming I have done so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have only pair programmed a couple of times so far, so I am no expert. The first time was with someone from North America, it was weird to begin with talking to your computer and hearing an american voice respond, but you soon forget that as you concentrate on the problems you are working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second time was with someone from the Netherlands. This time we tackled some trickier problems. Both times I took more of a back seat but I think contributed useful stuff and I certainly learnt a lot from the other person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that is the key thing about pair programming, you learn so much about how to look at a problem from another angle, or learn about a function you haven’t heard of before. If you are reading this and it was you that I pair programmed with a big thank you for spending the time with me, I learnt a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was trying to pair program again tonight but technical problems prevented me. One problem I have found is finding a partner, was hoping to do some yesterday but no one else was around to partner with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would be interested to learn what companies use pair programming. I imagine a pointy haired boss would say why pay two people to do one job, when you could get them working on different things. However if you want to build up your team and give them loads more skills then pair programming would be great. I also think there are probably some problems that are crying out for pair programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Javascript progress</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/javascript-progress/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/javascript-progress/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got excited earlier this week as I started playing around with the javascript I have been learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I would try and create useful javascript that could be applied to an online filestore. Somewhere that you could upload, delete, edit files and folders and various options to do with your files would popup via javascript or jquery code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I have created a static HTML page which lists a few dummy files. I have added a button which adds a new row into my table and I have used jquery to highlight any selected files and also when the mouse passes over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to follow my progress I have put my files on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/CodeSamples/tree/master/clouds-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
. It’s very basic stuff and I have already got a few lines I would like to refactor but not bad for an evenings work. I have lots of feature ideas to add to this page which should help me learn the basics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trouble with learning all this javascript is that I am starting to get all my programming languages confused. Earlier this week I started writing a for loop in javascript, only problem was I was working on an MS Access ADP (Don’t ask!) which requires the code in VBA. That is never going to work. Oh well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anyone knows good ways to stop myself getting my programming languages all confused do let me know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/hello-world-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/hello-world-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first program anyone writes in a new language is often really simple and just displays the text “Hello World!”, below are a few examples from languages I have knowledge of.&lt;/p>

My new years resolution is to do more coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over Christmas I thought I would have a go at &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.codecademy.com&lt;/a>
I completed the javascript course and I was just wondering what I should try next when I saw a tweet about &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.freecodecamp.com&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then I have been addicted to doing the exercises that they have, almost everyday I have made a bit of progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this site is not just about teaching you how to code, it has an active forum where you can ask questions and understand more about what it takes to become a developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I started these exercises I didn’t know much javascript or jquery but I am starting to learn quite a few commands that hopefully I can put into use at some point. Whatever development I end up doing I am sure I am going to need javascript at some point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the tips I have learnt is that you need to practise daily. Did you ever use flash cards to help pass exams? Well there is an electronic version of them now called Anki. Just add a question/answer pair to your deck of cards and review them each day, the ones you find difficult you review more often than the ones you have learnt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully I can keep this up and later in the year I will be well on way to writing lots of useful code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back at 2014</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/looking-back-at-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/looking-back-at-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>As today is New Years eve I thought it would be a good chance to look back over the last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tangle.jpg?resize=300%2C256&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the start of the year I finally got agreement for the installation of a 30MB leased line. This was an amazing achievement as I had been really struggling to keep everything working on our ADSL connections and the complexity of the connections was starting to cause problems itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However it was not a smooth process, the site survey revealed a substantial installation cost would be required, however the Council was about to launch a voucher scheme that would give us £3000 off. So most of this was just waiting around for the Council to get things going. By April we had it installed and I have been very happy with the ISP we chose, York Data Service (YDS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also during April this year was the end of support for Windows XP and Office 2003. This didn’t impact us too much, mostly due to my constant nagging of the directors to replace our oldest machines. We now only have a couple of machines still running XP and no machines running Office 2003. Most machines are now running Windows 7, I have one Director running Windows 8 for presentations and a few surveyor tablets running windows 8 as well. Like many businesses I am waiting for Windows 10 next year before doing any more substantial replacement of OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In May it was decided that I would move more into development work, so I got a new desktop PC and Visual Studio. I am very happy with my new machine (subject to dell fixing a problem later today) So far I have only dipped my toe into development work, this is largely due to needing more time to build up others to do what I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In June I made another huge achievement. I got agreement for a new server. This was our first Server 2012 server and allowed us to make huge strides towards virtualizing our services. Once we had this server up and running I was able to decommission two of our Windows Server 2003 machines well before it goes out of support next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a huge fan of this new server, I have only used a fraction of its memory. Hyper V is really great and I hope to make progress next year into HyperV replication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also during 2014 we made huge progress with our clouds software. Within the last few weeks it is running on the Azure platform which will not only make it far easier to expand and create new features it will provide us with cost savings. I am looking forward to learning more about Azure as I get deeper into development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow I achieved a lot didn’t I, on top of this I hired a new IT person and trained him up (still more to do), I have also fixed lots of printers, websites, servers (had a server motherboard die!), and made hundreds of changes to our internal databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know what is in store for 2015. I expect a lots of the same with hopefully more focus on developing in Visual Studio, training myself and my department and getting the last few tweaks into our internal servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would also like to thank everyone that I have worked with over the last 12 months (you know who you are), as you made a lot of what I have just described possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Developer Quiz</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/software-developer-quiz/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/software-developer-quiz/</guid><description>&lt;p>Moving house, lack of internet and lack of inspiration has caused a lack of posts recently but hopefully more to come. Been doing some filing and found an old software developer quiz. Thought I would have a go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zogface">Keith&lt;/a> for originally writing the quiz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Questions:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a function that determines the area of a circle given the radius&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add up all the values in an array of integers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Given a table called &amp;ldquo;Nodes&amp;rdquo; with the following structure and sample data (see below after questions):
…where ID is the primary key,andParentID references ID, complete the following:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>write a stored procedure to return all nodes beneath a given node ID&lt;/li>
&lt;li>describe how you might write a query to return all nodes at any depth below a given node ID (i.e. recursively)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a function to get the prime numbers up to 1,000,000&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ve been given the following code to review (below table)– what comments would you give back to the developer?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>ID&lt;/th>
&lt;th>ParentID&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Name&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Type&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Depth&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>1&lt;/td>

&lt;p>What’s with that? Why am I in a programming mood when I have boxes to pack and shelves to take apart?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the last few weeks I have been too busy with other things to do much programming or when I had the time I felt more like relaxing than learning anything new.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do I get into the programming zone, what was it about this particular weekend that made me want to? Was it just the fact I had no time to concentrate on it, or is there some more useful factor that controls my desire to code?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can think of a few factors that I should make note of.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Peace and quiet – Friday night I had the place to myself so I could concentrate and do whatever I wanted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideas – Before I started I had some ideas, why don’t I try doing x. Once I have a coding idea I need to investigate it and see where it goes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break from routine – Friday night was the start of a whole week away from work, this gives me more time to forget about the daily stress of the office and think about other things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals – Work annoyed me on Friday and if I want to achieve my goal of working in development more then I need to work at it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I am not sure how I can put these into practise so that I spend more time on development but we will see. One thing I want to achieve in my new home is a quiet place to concentrate and think without distractions, I have a few options which I will investigate over the next few weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway need to get back to packing boxes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To boldly go where no SQL has gone before Part 2</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s continue looking at a database schema for storing details of every Star Trek Episode. If you are new to databases, a schema is just the design of the structure of the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have three tables, Episode, EpisodeWriter and Writer. See my last post for more details of these. It has been suggested that a slight change to this structure would enable storage of more of the creative staff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets rename Writer and call it Credit, and rename EpisodeWriter and call it EpisodeCredit. Now any creative staff member involved in an episode can be stored in the Credit table. Lets alter EpisodeCredit and add an extra column called CreditType. CreditType is just a text field that stores the role that creative person had on that episode, it can be anything from Director, Writer, Actor, Science Consultant etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We now have the ability to store information relating to the episode in the episode table and any creative people in the credit table. What else can we add to the database? How about a table that can be used to record when an episode was last watched. I am probably weird but sometimes I want to watch a Star Trek episode that I like but I haven’t watched in ages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last watched table is really simple and just have a datetime field and episodeId. This can be further expanded to have a userId field if you wanted to keep track of what episodes your friends had been watching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another idea could be to tag episodes with certain themes or topics like Klingon episodes or meaning of life episodes or Kirk talks a computer to death episodes. Again this is fairly simple table containing TagName and EpisodeId.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To boldly go where no SQL has gone before</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before/</guid><description>&lt;p>My last post proved quite popular so I am wondering if I can combine a post about IT and Star Trek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years ago I used to have lists of Star Trek episodes, which included such information like original air date, production number, episode title and brief description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that was hard to keep track of was how many episodes were written by a specific person. This is because episodes are written by multiple people. A column called writer would then need to contain multiple people, another option would be to have columns called writer1, writer2 etc. This wouldn’t help either as you wouldn’t know which column a specific writer had been saved in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/manytomany.jpg?w=559&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The relationship between writer and episode is known as a many to many relationship. An episode can have many writers and a writer can have written many episodes. To achieve this structure in a SQL database you will need three database tables as it is not possible to create a many to many join between two tables. The first table will contain all the episodes, the second table will contain all the writers, the third table known as a junction table, will contain the relationship between the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s do an example so we can see how this would work. Gene Roddenberry creator of Star Trek wrote the pilot episode ‘The Cage’. So Gene would be added to the writers table with an id of 1 and The Cage would be added to the episode table with an id of 1. In the junction table, it has two columns episode and writer, so we would enter 1 and 1 into these columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Select&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">from&lt;/span> Episode e
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Join&lt;/span> EpisodeWriter ew &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">on&lt;/span> e.id &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> ew.EpisodeId

But what is the difference between development and what I already do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put simply Development or programming is the creation of new programs, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IT Operations or System Administration is the administration of existing servers, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been doing System Administration since I started my job back in 2006. What you do as part of this role can be very simple like setting up new users or computers to something very complex like upgrading the version of Exchange that the company uses for its emails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of my role I have done a lot of tasks that could be described as development. I have created databases and built new database structures like tables, views and stored procedures. I have also assisted the development department with testing, setting up visual studio, building websites and databases from code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I describe myself as a developer? I would say yes, I have done plenty of work that is development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I get a job as a developer? Possibly but it would depend on the role. I have many of the skills that developers use, but I have limited knowledge in many areas. What I need to do is concentrate my efforts onto the development work I do and delegate as much administration work as I can so my knowledge can increase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Buzz word in IT at the moment is DevOps. I have lost count of the number of times .NetRocks or RunAsRadio have mentioned it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DevOps is the integration of IT Development and Operations, it emphasises the need for the two departments to work closely together to achieve common goals. In big companies the two departments can pull against each other if you are not careful, but in my case as I do both roles, it would be very difficult for the development side of myself to blame the operations side of myself for a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This I think puts me in a good position, I just need to learn more development and I will make a valuable addition to someone’s development team.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
