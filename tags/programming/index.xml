&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the syntax for BASIC, luckily I have been able to find the &lt;a href="http://elborg.dk/books.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manual&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the commands are listed inside so lets see what we can do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx presents you with a command prompt in which you can type text. Back in the 80s we had a tape player to load programs from tape, however I don&amp;rsquo;t have one today so only programs I write can be run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRINT - To write Hello World, you can just type PRINT &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; and Hello World appears on the screen. To Write a program that displays Hello World, you just write the line number first.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 PRINT &amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run this you type RUN
To view the code you type LIST&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Edit a specific Line you can use Ctrl+E and type the line number, or you can just write the line out again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CLS - This command clears the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INPUT N - stores text typed by the user and stores it in the variable N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GOTO N - Execution of code continues at Line Number N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Program I wrote with a bit of help from my boys.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 CLS
20 PRINT &amp;#34;What is your Age?&amp;#34;
30 INPUT N
40 IF N&amp;gt;5 AND N&amp;lt;41 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a good age&amp;#34;
50 ELSE IF N&amp;lt;6 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a spaceman&amp;#34;
60 ELSE IF N&amp;gt;40 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>My 4yo didn&amp;rsquo;t like being &amp;ldquo;too young&amp;rdquo; in the original version, so my 6yo helped me change him to be a &amp;ldquo;spaceman&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not bad and it was fun pair programming with a 6yo, all my typos were quickly spotted, and he easily understood the logic of IF/ELSE/THEN statements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx comes from 1983 and has just 96k of memory. I am very lucky it actually still works, however I have been able to find an emulator so I can write Lynx BASIC from the comfort of my laptop. &lt;a href="https://jynxemulator.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jynxemulator&lt;/a>
, it is also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonathan-markland/Jynx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the ROMs so getting from the website is a better option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The developer experience today is so much nicer than it must have been in the 1980s, however back then distractions must have been much reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No internet or google to get answers to your questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Copy/Paste of text&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Load/Save (unless you have a working disk drive or tape player!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No IDE&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Build or Release process just type RUN&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DotNet on a Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have had a Raspberry Pi for a few years and recently I connected it up again, I plugged in the camera and everything worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start off you can view photos from the camera with the raspistill command. With a bit of clever scripting and the crontab I got the Pi taking pictures every 60 seconds. Even managed to take a nice picture of a robin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e21z7vbamy6w6akhhiwd.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However scripting isn&amp;rsquo;t really programming, and I would like to write a bit more code. Dotnet can run everywhere these days and it made sense to see if it would run on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@pete_codes has written a nice guide to getting started with dotnet on a Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/&lt;/a>
This guide and the nuget package &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/&lt;/a>
was all I needed to get started taking pictures with my Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial goal is to take some wildlife pictures, stick my camera to a window and take pictures of what flies/crawls/jumps past the window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code I have written so far is available on github &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the code takes a picture, uploads this file to Azure Blob Storage (so as not to fill up the Pi with too many image files) and deletes the image locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run a dotnet publish -c Release and then cron can run dotnet RaspberryPiDotNet.dll (with full paths to the relevant files)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use crontab to execute the code every 60 seconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My code has an appsetting.json file which has a couple of settings that need completing for my code to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storage: This is the connection string for Azure Blob Storage
LocalPath: This is the path to where the camera will save its photos to, something like /home/pi/ is all you need but feel free to specify what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the photos are in blob storage I plan to display them somewhere, add options to delete what I don&amp;rsquo;t want, maybe do something timelapsey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper release pipeline and this grates on me a bit. I have been doing a mixture of writing code in VS and pushing that to github and then doing git pull on the Pi, and also writing code directly on the Pi. (VS Code can connect via SSH which is pretty cool!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQL with Visual Studio Code</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-with-visual-studio-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-with-visual-studio-code/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing SQL queries is typically done with SQL Management Studio (SSMS). However this tool is a bit of a beast so let’s look at how you could use Visual Studio Code instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio Code is a free text editor but it is so much more than just a text editor. VS Code can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com/Download&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work with SQL Server download the mssql extension. Press &lt;strong>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/strong> and then Select &lt;strong>Install Extension&lt;/strong> and type &lt;strong>mssql&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intellisense in Visual Studio Code is brilliant, better than SSMS. Lets look at how to get it all set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new file and set the language type to SQL (Press &lt;strong>CTRL+K,M&lt;/strong> )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open the command palette, &lt;strong>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/strong> and type SQL to show the mssql commands. Select the Connect command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then select &lt;strong>Create Connection Profile&lt;/strong> , this creates a profile to connect with your SQL Server. Follow the prompts to get it all setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look in the bottom right corner of the status bar and you should see you are connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you type sql you will see a long list of SQL code snippets that you could use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-sql-snippets.png?resize=662%2C348&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a snippet to create, and edit it as required. When you are happy press **CTRL+SHIFT+E ** to execute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is basically all there is to it. However this is an incredibly powerful way of working, the intellisense instantly tells you what database objects you can use in your query and there is a wealth of different snippets you can use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When returning data you get a similar view to SSMS but you can save as Excel, CSV or JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SSMS is a very graphical way of doing things, you can double click a table and see its columns or indexes. VS Code relies on TSQL commands but you have access to exactly the same information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information about VS Code and the mssql extension check out &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode&lt;/a>

about learning about interfaces as I didn’t really understand the value of them. I do now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created an application that used interfaces so I could learn how it worked. I created a Logger Interface and created multiple classes that implemented that interface so I could swap out the different implementations easily. I created a SQL Logger and a File Logger and my code could be written and be completely unaware of which implementation it was using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This application uses SQL Azure and so I have a monthly bill to pay. Wouldn’t it be cool if I could reduce this bill? How about using the cheaper table storage instead?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Easy!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new class that implements my interface and all I need to do is write the three methods defined in my interface and I can swap from SQL Azure to table storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit to interfaces is testing. Say I have an interface called inotification for sending notifications, I can have several implementations of this email, twitter, slack etc&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of these implementations should be used in unit tests, as you don’t want a tweet being sent every time you run your tests. Why not create an implementation that simply returns something for each method call and doesn’t actually do anything. I can then run my tests with my fake implementation which tests my code logic but not the implementation I have chosen (this can be tested later on with integration tests or user testing if required).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is pretty much all I have to say about interfaces. I just like how I can swap different implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It does take a bit of work to get the interface setup. I found that when writing the second implementation the interface would need to change slightly, mostly as it was badly designed to begin with. I think for beginners there may be some value to writing multiple implementations of an interface so you can be sure your interface is good, however I am sure with experience this will not be required.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure Friday</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-friday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-friday/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think Azure is great, but there is loads to it so I can never know about all of its features. There is a video series hosted by Scott Hanselman called &lt;a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Fridays&lt;/a>
which I have started to watch in an effort to keep more up to date about some of its cool features.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I watched this video recently and it is all about application insights and new ways you can debug your web applications by creating snapshots. I am a big fan of application insights so adding extra ways to debug my apps is a big win for me. Once I get this feature working in my code I will no doubt blog about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure Functions</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-functions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-functions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently blogged about using &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff">Azure Web Jobs&lt;/a>
, Azure Function is another way of doing the same thing, lets look at how they work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Sorry its been a while since I blogged but I suspect an erratic schedule will continue for the next few months.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create an Azure Function go to the Azure portal and click add new and search for &amp;ldquo;Function App&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give your app a name and select the usual resource group and location settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now when you open Function Apps you should see your new app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want my Function App to run on a schedule so I clicked the + next to functions and selected TimerTrigger. I am a c# programmer so I selected this option as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give your function a name and specify using the usual cron notation how often it should run. I want mine to run at 9.30pm each night so use 0 30 21 * * *&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now comes the code bit. By default you get a window with the following code in it&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">$&amp;#34;C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It is entirely up to you what you get your function to do. In my case I just wanted to call a URL on a schedule so I created some code that used httpclient.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System.Net.Http;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">$&amp;#34;Buffer 0 function executed at: {DateTime.Now}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> HttpClient client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> HttpClient();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> result = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> client.GetAsync(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;URL&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> resultContent = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(resultContent);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once you have created your app and it has run you can use the monitor section to view success and failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is loads more you can do with Azure Function but this is a good place to start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pwned Pass – Available from the Play Store</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/pwned-pass-available-from-the-play-store/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/pwned-pass-available-from-the-play-store/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pwned Pass is now available from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Pwned Pass" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170813-205152.png?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pwned Pass is a simple android app that allows you to type in a password and tells you if it has been used in a data breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt of &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Have I Been Pwned?&lt;/a>
recently added a new API to his website which allows you to search his extensive database of pwned passwords, 306 million of them. I have simply created a Android frontend to this API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The API itself takes a SHA1 hash of the password and either returns a HTTP 200 if the password is found or a HTTP 404 if the password does not exist in the HIBP database. For more details of how Troy Hunt created this check out his &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My app simply generates a SHA1 hash of anything that is typed in and then passes this to Troy Hunt’s API. I then get the HTTP return code so I know if the password exists or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be noted that: &lt;strong>Do not send any password you actively use to a third-party service – even this one!&lt;/strong> I don’t log anything that you type into my app and all I am then doing is passing a SHA1 hash over SSL to HIBP. However you shouldn’t trust my word alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app itself is written in Visual Studio with Xamarin Forms in a similar fashion to the app I talked about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre">last week&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I am using Xamarin Forms there is the potential that I may develop iPhone or UWP versions of this code in the future. With that in mind I have made use of interfaces for the android specific parts of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also make use of the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/modernhttpclient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modernhttpclient&lt;/a>
nuget package due to problems I encountered with httpclient and SSL. This is due to limitations of what libraries are available in mono and what has been implemented, I suspect there are better ways to solve this but that is all part of the fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please do have a look at Pwned Pass and let me know what you think. Especially if it doesn’t work or throws errors. I would like to spend time making this app as good as I can make it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Android App Development and the Visual Studio Mobile Centre</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past week or so I have been playing around with Xamarin and creating an android app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well I now have an app in the Google Play Store. Check out &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6148298088834956775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6148298088834956775&lt;/a>
. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170806-190053.png?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you rush and download the app I must warn you that it doesn’t do much yet. It displays some content that is on my website and there are a few links to allow sharing of content. I have some ideas to display content from my blog and allow sharing. I also have some other ideas for apps that might actually be useful to people that are not me. If you have ideas or feature requests do let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok how did I go about creating this app and getting it in the app store?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xamarin is now part of Visual Studio so step one is install all the Xamarin features to Visual Studio and build an app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I wanted to monitor my app. Now I know Application Insights doesn’t support apps so what tools are out there? HockeyApp is something I had heard of but they are in the process of being replaced with &lt;a href="https://appcenter.ms/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Mobile Centre&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was relatively easy to hook up my app to Visual Studio Mobile Centre. First install the required nuget packages. Then add using statements and the following line to your MainActivity.cs file (these instructions are available on the Mobile Centre)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Analytics;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Crashes;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Distribute;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Push;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>MobileCenter.Start(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;[Unique ID]&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Analytics), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Crashes), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Distribute), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Push));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now you can connect the Mobile Centre to your source code (VSTS in my case) and get it to run a build for every commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One complexity of the build is that you need to supply a keystore file (basically a certificate to digitally sign your app). I found the best way to do this was to use Visual Studio to create the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In VS2017 there is a option called Archive Manager under the tools menu. In here click the distribute button and select Ad-hoc. In the signing identity section you can create a keystore file. Enter a few details and a keystore file will be created in AppData\Local\Xamarin\Mono for Android\Keystore[keystore name][keystore name.keystore]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have added the keystore file to your build you can enable the distribute option. Now you will get an email after every build with a link to install your app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time your app crashes the details will be logged in the crashes section for you to explore and fix the issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Analytics section allows you to explore how your app is being used. You can also add Analytics.TrackEvent(&amp;ldquo;Feature X&amp;rdquo;) to measure the usage of different features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are more things you can do which I will explore more at another time along with how to get your app into the Google Play Store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Async and Await</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/async-and-await/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/async-and-await/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while the Async and Await commands in c# have confused me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like most things the best way to learn about something is to use it in a real world example. I am currently adding an email alert feature to a website. This is an ideal example of something that would benefit from Asynchronous programming. There is no need for the webpage to wait to send 1000s of emails, lets just send a call to get started and allow the browser to carry on as normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my first try at using async and await so feel free to suggest best practises in the comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start with a Send method in my EmailController.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> ActionResult Send(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> id, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> pageId, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> userID)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (!Authorize.checkPageIsAuthorised(userID, (Authorize.PageIds)pageId))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Redirect(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;/login&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Task&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>&amp;gt; t = SendNotifications(id,userID);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Redirect(Request.UrlReferrer.ToString());
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This simply checks to see if you have permission to the page. If not redirects to the login page otherwise it makes a method call and redirects back to the page it came from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets have a look at that method call in more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Task&lt;string> t = SendNotification(id, userid);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SendNotification doesn’t return a normal string it returns a Task&lt;string>, so lets look at how we are creating this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>&amp;gt; SendNotifications(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> id,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> type,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> userid)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//logic ommitted&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> ef.SendEmail(model, emailHtmlBody);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The return type is set to Task but it has the aysnc keyword appended to it. It also makes a call with the await keyword.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task SendEmail(EmailModel model,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> emailHtmlBody)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//logic removed&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> smtp.SendMailAsync(message);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So that is it. My first bit of code that uses Async and Await. My controller calls a method asynchronously which then calls another method asynchronously which sends emails asynchronously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Async – This enables the Await keyword to be used in the method&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Await – This is where things get asynchronous. The await keyword allows the code to wait asynchronously for the long running code to complete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing your first test</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/writing-your-first-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/writing-your-first-test/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whenever I write a new test I have to think how best to do it. Hopefully I can summarise a few tips here to help get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="arrange-act-assert">Arrange Act Assert&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#arrange-act-assert">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first thing I think about when writing a test is Arrange, Act, Assert. Arrange, Act, Assert is a pattern for writing the tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arrange&lt;/strong> – This gets things in order ready to execute the test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Act&lt;/strong> – This executes the method you want to test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Assert&lt;/strong> – This compares the value produced in the Act step with a known value typically with a method similar to the following&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assert.AreEqual(expected value, actual value)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Say for example you wanted to test a method called ReturnsTrue() which does nothing but returns a value of true. This method is in a class called ReturnsTrueClass&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Arrange step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ReturnsTrueClass t = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ReturnsTrueClass();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The Act step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> result = t.ReturnTrue();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The Assert step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Assert.AreEqual(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>, result);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is a stupidly simple example but hopefully you get the idea of how you can build all your tests with these three steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I saw a tweet complaining that someone has mixed up expected and actual in the Assert statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a minor but special hell reserved for those who mix up the expected and actual parameters in Assert.Equals&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Keith Williams (@zogface) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zogface/status/882737770095149056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2017&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>At first glance this probably isn’t the worst mistake to make as if your tests are all passing actual and expected are the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However tests will fail, that is the whole point of them, you can then fix bits of code. If you have mixed up actual and expected it adds extra time to debugging and figuring out what values are produced from your code and what you are expecting it to produce. It may be your test uses a mocking framework and somewhere in there, there is an issue, with mixed up expected/actual you may assume a problem in your code rather than the test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, how do you make such an error? When I type Assert.AreEquals() in Visual Studio, Visual Studio tells me what each parameter does, it takes a matter of seconds to do this, just by hovering over the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last tip to say about tests. Write your tests to test the behaviour of your application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uploading Files to AWS</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/uploading-files-to-aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/uploading-files-to-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a fan of Azure but today I have been looking at AWS. Specifically how to upload and download files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS S3 stores files in Buckets. I already had an AWS S3 account setup with a Bucket. I am going to assume you have got a bucket setup and concentrate on the code to get files in and out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First step is to use nuget to install the AWS packages. In nuget the packages you want are called AWSSDK.Core and AWSSDK.S3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The using statements you want to use are called Amazon.S3 and Amazon.S3.Transfer, not sure why this doesn’t match nuget, this difference caught me out a couple of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to the code that uploads files&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> InputStream = streamWriter,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = fileName
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Lets break it down and look at what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of AmazonS3Client, we are passing the Access Key and Secret Access Key both of which can be found from your Amazon S3 account My Security Credentials section. Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1 specifies the amazon data centres that your bucket is located in.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of TransfterUtility using the AmazonS3Client instance we created in the previous step.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This opens up a filestream from a files path and specifies that the file should be opened.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> InputStream = streamWriter,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = fileName
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>};
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This last step specifies which bucket to upload to, what input stream to upload and the Key to use. Key is just AWS way of referring to files, more commonly referred to as the filename.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all you need to do to upload a file to your Bucket. The file will be located at &lt;a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]&lt;/a>
, however by default it will not be downloadable until you set Read permission to everyone, once you do that anyone who has the link will be able to download your file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the same permission level as any file you have on your webserver, however AWS has a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (s3Client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> GetPreSignedUrlRequest request1 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> GetPreSignedUrlRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = bucketName,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = filename,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Expires = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">5&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> urlString = s3Client.GetPreSignedURL(request1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we are generating a url to download the file, but we are specifying that it is only valid for 5 minutes. This means that if you share the url it will only work for 5 minutes, after that AWS will give an access denied message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is much better security than you have on a typical web server, and easy to implement, every time a user clicks on a download link you generate a new presigned url and send the download to the browser, as long as this process doesn’t take longer than 5 minutes the user will never know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Azure WebJobs to Automate Stuff</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</guid><description>&lt;p>I keep hearing about Azure WebJobs but I have never used them. Time to change this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that can run a script at a specific time. In my case I would like to hit a specific url of my website at the same time every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="WebJobs" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/addkeepalivewebjob.png?resize=313%2C615&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
To the right you can see an example of the WebJobs form on the Azure portal that you need to fill in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to supply a name for your webjob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to upload the script that will run in my case I used a powershell script. My script consisted of which basically just loads the url specified.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$progressPreference = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;silentlyContinue&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri (&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.google.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>) -Method Get -UseBasicParsing;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Type refers to if your job will be triggered or run continuously, I want it to be triggered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Triggers refers to if you want it to be scheduled or manual, something that you can run on an ad hoc basis. I of course want scheduled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are familiar with the linux CRON then the next box will make sense to you for everyone else I will try and make sense of it. The box consists of 6 numbers which can either have a value or a *. The numbers correspond to the following {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hourly job would be expressed as 0 0 * * * *, ie every day of week, every month, every day, every hour and only when minute and second equals zero. For more help with this check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs#CreateScheduledCRON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSDN docs&lt;/a>
about it. I want to use 0 30 21 * * * to run daily at 9.30pm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it everything setup, now time to wait and see if it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Oh no!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It failed to run at the specified time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason for this is the scheduler requires the feature Always On to be turned on which is not available in the free App Service. Before you reach for your wallets, I found a solution on this &lt;a href="https://tomssl.com/2016/12/20/how-to-get-azure-webjobs-to-run-indefinitely-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
that allows them to run on the free tier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thinking behind this solution is you need to keep the website alive throughout the day so Tom has created a script that does this.

&lt;p>Set this script up to run every 5 minutes (0 */5 * * * *) like the example above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nextthing you need to do is create a Custom connection string in the Application Settings blade called SecretThing. Tom’s script references this to access the website and keep it alive. The password you need to put in SecretThing can be found in you publish profile (downloaded from the Overview blade in the Azure portal).

&lt;p>One last thing to mention about WebJobs is that you can see details about when they have run at https://[YourWebAppName].scm.azurewebsites.net/azurejobs/#/jobs and this can be a great place to help debug your scripts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interfaces</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/interfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am trying to understand interfaces and when to use them in my code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interface defines a contract and any class that implements that interface agrees to fulfil that contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at an example as this tends to be how I learn best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most applications require some sort of data to work from so lets start by defining IData which can load data.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">interface&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">IData&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>My interface defines one method LoadData and outputs an object called Blog (I will explain why in a minute)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common data source is a SQL database so we could define a SQL class that implements IData.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">SQL&lt;/span> : IData
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog blog = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Blog();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (SqlConnection con = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> SqlConnection(Connectionstring))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> con.Open();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We could also get data from an RSS feed of a blog (hence why I called the object Blog earlier)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">XML&lt;/span> : IData
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> XmlDocument myXmlDocument = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> XmlDocument();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> myXmlDocument.Load(Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog blog = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Blog();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach&lt;/span> (XmlNode RootNode &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">in&lt;/span> myXmlDocument.ChildNodes)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Both classes implement IData and have a method called LoadData which has a string parameter and outputs a blog object. The string parameter is either a connection string to a SQL database or the URL of the rss feed. Not sure if there is a better way of doing this bit, maybe the name of the string needs making more generic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have some classes that implement an interface what can we do with them. Lets write a class called GetData which gets data but doesn’t care if it comes form the rss feed or a SQL database.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">GetData&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> IData &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> GetData(IData repo)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> original = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo.LoadData(Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> original;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When we call GetData we can either pass in XML or SQL as the class is not tied to either implementation. We could even write other classes that implement IData for testing purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My full code can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/InterfaceExample" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantages of writing code in this way include code that is easier to extend, easier to test and easier to maintain. This is only the start of my understanding and I am sure this is going to be a topic I come back to in the next few weeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning R</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/learning-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/learning-r/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="R" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Exchange-Rate-Calculator.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
Today I spent some time learning the R language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem I was trying to solve was to convert local prices of some items into Euros. I had been using a fixed exchange rate for all data, but as exchange rates fluctuate so much this is incorrect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first though was to find a free API that I could query to get the values I wanted. The first API I found didn’t cover all the currencies, the next one I found I burnt through the free allowance in one pass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A colleague of mine mentioned using R to solve this, he sent me some links and I set out to write my first piece of R code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My finished code can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/ExchangeRate/blob/master/script.R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
and I will attempt to explain some of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R defines functions fairly simply&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>nameoffunction &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">function&lt;/span>(arg1, arg2)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>arg1 &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> arg2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have created a function that takes 2 parameters date and currency. I know I have about 10 different currencies that I want to get currencies for and I want to loop through each day so I will need to pass in a date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The source of my exchange rate information is the &lt;a href="https://www.xe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.xe.com&lt;/a>
website, its historical exchange rate page passes currency and date into the query string so I should be able to build up a string containing all the different elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All programming language can concatenate strings and R is no different. R uses paste()&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However R has an annoying feature in this function. I would expect that var in the above example would contain &amp;ldquo;HelloWorld&amp;rdquo;, it doesn’t it contains &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;. Why it automatically adds a space I don’t know?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, sep&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I am not entirely sure what all of the code does but I can take a good guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>read_html() I would guess loads a html page, html_nodes() finds all the html tags of a certain type on the page, in my case &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;, html_table() reads the first table it finds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>table1[2] selects the second column, and head() selects a specific number of rows. I want the first row and second column so I combine these two as head(table1[2],1)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have found my exchange rate what do I do with it? R can read and write to SQL Server so why not store this info in a SQL lookup table. I can then use this data in a stored procedure when I process my data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To query sql you can use sqlQuery(), it has two parameters, a sql connection and a TSQL command (eg a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE statement)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use a while loop to loop through every day between 1st October 2016 and today and look up the exchange rate for each currency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now I am manually running this R script, however there are ways to run R directly from SQL Server which I may well investigate. I could then have a SQL job to run this on a schedule, maybe once a day to get the latest exchange rates. I also would like to do something a bit cleverer like only getting exchange rates for the days that I need them by querying existing database tables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon Web Services</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a big fan of Azure but I know zero about its biggest rival – Amazon Web Services or AWS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So lets sign up for a free trial and see what it can do. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Amazon Web Services" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aws-300x169.png?resize=300%2C169" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AWS free trial is available from &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/free/&lt;/a>
and lasts for 12 months. From memory I think the Azure free trial lasted only one month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start you need to login with your amazon account and create an AWS account. This requires your name and address and your payment info (you will only get billed if use services not covered by your free trial).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly AWS requires you to verify your identity via an automated phone call. (I don’t recall doing anything like this for Azure but please correct me if I am wrong.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are logged in you get a series of links displaying all the different services that are available. First impression is this is a simpler view to Azure’s portal with a similar amount of services. At the top right is an option to select which region you want to use, in Azure I use North Europe and West Europe, AWS has Ireland and Frankfurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-web-app">Create a Web App&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#create-a-web-app">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First thing to try is setting up a website. I selected create a web app and I get a page asking me for its basic details (very similar to Azure, however AWS asked what language your code is written in, Azure handles all of these) AWS websites appear to support a host of different options similar to Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The actual creation of your website takes a few moments (like on Azure). However the default URL for websites is similar to &lt;a href="http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/&lt;/a>
which is not quite as nice as the Azure equivalent &lt;a href="http://test.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.azurewebsites.net&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure has a host of command lines available via powershell. AWS has a similar command line interface called AWS CLI, including the option to deploy from git to your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is an extension that allows for the publishing of websites to AWS. (Just like you can publish to Azure)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I learn more about AWS I will continue to blog about it. &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/08/04/amazon-web-services-pt-2/">Amazon Web Services Pt 2&lt;/a>

&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="SQL Server Management Studio" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sql-server-2012-management-studio-splash-screen.png?resize=529%2C360" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have enjoyed seeing the improvements that each new version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) introduced. One great improvement was intellisense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature saves typing and reduces errors by automatically suggesting tables, column names or other database objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common query that I get asked to write is provide a spreadsheet that gives the information that satisfies certain criteria. This is easy to do in SSMS, you can write the query, click execute and the rows that satisfy the criteria are displayed. These rows can then be easily copy/pasted into Excel or other spreadsheets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common data item that gets stored in databases is addresses and addresses often contain line breaks to make the data display better. In the earlier versions of SSMS, when you copied and pasted these line breaks were ignored and the data displayed the same in SSMS as it did in Excel. However in the more recent version, theses line breaks got copied across breaking your spreadsheet and making it hard to see what data corresponded with what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I don’t know if this should be described as introducing a bug or fixing one. I can easily argue both sides. If your data contains a line break and you copy this data it should include the line break in the destination, but if it does that it displays badly in Excel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fix I have been using until recently is to use the following TSQL command in my queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">REPLACE&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">REPLACE&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#f92672">@&lt;/span>str, CHAR(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">13&lt;/span>), &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;), CHAR(10), &amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This command replaces any line breaks with an empty string. Both Char(10) and Char(13) are needed because you can have different types of line breaks. This is great if you are writing the script from scratch but isn’t great if your are running a stored procedure or your query has a lot of columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this is to use Visual Studio to run your SQL query. In Visual Studio you can write and run queries via Server Explorer and the results produced don’t contain line breaks. I have only just discovered this solution, but so far it has worked and is very easy to do, plus as I do most of my development in Visual Studio anyway it saves me having to open SSMS to test my queries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unmanaged Database Deployment</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/unmanaged-database-deployment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/unmanaged-database-deployment/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past few months I have been deploying changes to my companies database every couple of weeks or so. Over a weekend when the database was not being used I would make a backup of the database, load up visual studio, deploy the database changes and copy a couple of front-end files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My weekends and evenings have recently become a bit more precious to me since the arrival of my son James. At suitable times to run the database upgrade I am either, asleep, about to fall asleep or be spending time with James.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This entire deployment can be set to run at a time of my choosing using SQL Server Jobs, (not sure why I never thought of doing this before). I still need to check everything is working after it has run. The job can send me an email if it encounters any problems so I can still ensure the company has the minimum of problems but has more frequent changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="unmanaged-database-deployment">Unmanaged Database Deployment&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#unmanaged-database-deployment">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OK so what do I need to do to set this up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/deploy.jpg?resize=263%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Test all your code changes are working correctly on a backup of the database and everything is committed to source control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Backup everything that is going to be changed so it can be rolled back in case of a problem. I don’t rely on the daily backup jobs for this, I do my own. Maybe I am a bit paranoid, or maybe I am just being cautious.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>BACKUP &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DATABASE&lt;/span> DBName &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">TO&lt;/span> DISK&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;E:\SQL Backups\Filename.bak&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I would include in the backup file name the date and time of the deployment for easy reference later on. For the front-end files these are backed up daily and only ever change during a deployment so I am going to rely on the day to day backups, plus they are in source control so in a worse case scenario I can look there.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>From Visual Studio create a deployment script using the publish option and save as a file on your database server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a SQL Server Job and give it a descriptive name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In steps create a step called backup and enter the T-SQL code above. Set this to stop on failure and continue on success.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a second step called upgrade of type operating system with the following code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>sqlcmd -S (local) -i &amp;#34;E:\SQL Backups\deploy_test.sql&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The -S parameter is the name of your SQL Server instance and the -i parameter is the path to the sql script you generated from Visual Studio above. Set this job to quit reporting success or failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>In schedule create a date time you want the job to run, make sure this is a one time job as you don’t want it to try and run again possibly causing problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In notifications I have set to email on completion, you can set it to email on failure only. I would prefer to know the outcome of the job regardless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using SQL Server jobs to copy files over the network is possible but is not trivial to setup so I am going to use windows task scheduler for this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a job in task scheduler to copy all the ADPs or ADEs that have been changed. If the SQL job fails you will need to copy the old versions of these back but that is simple enough to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This process can be expanded to check code out of source control and do even more automated deployments but for now this is good enough for my purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things to know before working on your database</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/things-to-know-before-working-on-your-databasethings-to-know-before-working-on-your-database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/things-to-know-before-working-on-your-databasethings-to-know-before-working-on-your-database/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently saw this blog &lt;a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/07/questions-to-ask-before-you-touch-a-database-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post&lt;/a>
by &lt;a href="http://www.brentozar.com/team/brent-ozar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Ozar&lt;/a>
that I thought I might discuss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brent listed 13 questions to ask about a database before you start working with it. I am going to go through these 13 questions and expand on them based on my experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is this database in production now?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I think it should go without saying that the first thing you should find out is if your database is in production. If its not in production you can do what you like and no one will notice.
I know what databases are in production and which aren’t where I work so I can answer this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If this goes down, what apps go down with it?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>What apps are running on what databases is a good second question. I have at least one database which has multiple front end apps. At first glance you would think that that these two apps are not connected but they are, I need to be careful with both of these apps to make sure they don’t break each other.
I know what apps run off what databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When those apps go down, is there potential for loss of life or money?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is a difficult question so I will split it into two. Loss of life, my databases don’t control life support machines or nuclear weapons so my first instinct would be to say no. However it is not that straightforward, what if your app allowed contractors to know the location of dangers inside a property they were working in. Once your app goes down, they could have an accident due to lack of information.
Loss of money, this one is more straightforward. Time is money in the business world so any time that your app is down and your employees are not able to work is a loss of money. If your database is linked to an eCommerce site, the loss of money could be extremely high.
I know what affect downtime will have on my users and business.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How sensitive are these apps to temporary slowdowns?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Similar to the previous question, a slowdown can be as serious as downtime for some applications.
Luckily most of my apps are internal only so are not seriously affected by slowness.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful backup?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I manage the backup schedule for all my databases so I know exactly when each one was last backed up. When ever I do anything to a production database I will run a backup so I can roll back in case of problems. As part of developing changes I run my changes on a backup of the data. I can script all my changes and repeatedly run them against a backup until I am sure no problems will occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/uf010206.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful restore test?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>More important than a backup is testing restoring your databases. If you can’t restore data then your backup is useless. I try to test restoring my backups at least weekly so I know that I can rely on my backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is everyone okay losing data back to the last successful backup?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If disaster strikes you could loose all data between now and the time of your last backup. But all is not lost transactional backups can be scheduled throughout the day, in my case the most data we could loose is 15 minutes. This could be configured to be more or less frequent depending on your data. But remember the previous question and make sure you test a restore of your transactional backups, if you can’t restore from them you will be forced to restore from the last successful backup.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="8">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful clean corruption test?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Corruption can be a killer if it is not found quickly. If you need to restore to the last backup before corruption occurred this could result in a significant amount of data loss. To check for corruption you need to run DBCC regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="9">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do we have a development or staging environment where I can test my changes first?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If the answer to this is no, then your next job is to setup a development or staging area. Having a development environment makes development a lot easier and I don’t think I could manage to do all the changes I have done recently without one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="10">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is there any documentation for why the server was configured this way?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I really wish we had more documentation about configurations as it would make finding out why thing were setup the way they are. So unfortunately the answer to this question is No.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="11">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What changes am I not allowed to make?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Depending on what your app does, where it is hosted, how quick the changes are needed and many other factors will all restrict what changes you can make. Historical decisions on the database can also affect what changes can be made, if the database has been structured in a certain way, it may be very difficult to restructure it in a more efficient way.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="12">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who can test that my changes fixed the problem?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is an interesting question, from experience the best people to speak to about problems with the database are the users. If they can show you how to reproduce a problem, you should be able to fix this problem, after that you can probably get them to verify that it has been fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="13">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who can test that the apps still work as designed, and that my changes didn’t have unintended side effects?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is an extension of the previous question. The main users of your app should be your first port of call to find out if the app works as expected. However exploring side affects and undesired features is something that I would test as part of the development process. It has taken a while but I have constructed a detailed check list that can be used for testing so I know that most bugs can be found before release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Source Control Fail</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-control-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-control-fail/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every developer uses source control, it is a great tool for keeping track of changes to your code, seeing who has done what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However I keep messing up, my use of it. I am fairly disciplined when creating new features, all my changes will get committed to source control and when I am happy I will deploy these changes to the live system. But as soon as there is a bug, especially one where the client is chasing for a fix, I will deploy a fix as soon as humanly possible on to the live system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance there is nothing wrong with what I have described but what happens the next time I deploy a new feature. Yes the bug the client was complaining about gets deployed with the new feature as the fix was never committed into source control. The client gets angry as the bug he was screaming about is back again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every change you make to the system &lt;strong>MUST&lt;/strong> be committed to source control. If it isn’t that change will look like it never existed. I have worked with source control for over 5 years why do I keep making this rookie mistake over and over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt has a &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/05/10-commandments-of-good-source-control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
about the 10 commandments of using source control. His number two commandment is “If it’s not in source control, it doesn’t exist” He talks more about code you have written being not saved into source control, but the principal is the same for my example as his.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are ways to automatically deploy from source control, however most of the time you don’t want your live database being rebuilt because you fixed a typo. Additional steps will need to be implemented and there is still the chance that you might want to bypass these steps to fix the urgent problem. The only way past this problem is for you and everyone on your team to be disciplined and only ever commit to source control first, and only after that deploy live (either automatically or manually)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tidying my desktop</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/tidying-my-desktop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/tidying-my-desktop/</guid><description>&lt;p>My desktop is always a mess. I constantly download files there and forget all about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every now and then I copy files into sub directories, so my desktop looks sane for a day or two before it gets out of control again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don’t I write a script that I can schedule to do this for me. Then my desktop will always be tidy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have written a few simple batch scripts, but of course the best scripting language out there at the moment is PowerShell. Lets use that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows provides a nice little utility for writing scripts called the Windows PowerShell ISE, so let&amp;rsquo;s start by loading that up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS has lots of help included to help you, just run &lt;strong>Get-Help [name of ps command]&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To move files you can use &lt;strong>Move-Item&lt;/strong> which works very similar to copy, specify source and destination. In my case I moved files based on their file extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Move-Item *.pdf folder&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all I need to do is schedule this script to run either every day or so, or maybe every time I login or switch my computer on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PowerShell can do lots more interesting things which hopefully I will blog about soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Source Code for Game of Life</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-code-for-game-of-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 09:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-code-for-game-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I blogged about the Game of Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well it took some searching through dead hard drives and old USB storage but I found the program I wrote, and better than that I have figured out how to turn it back into source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The file date is November 2004 and the source code has no comments so I don’t know what was going through my head when I wrote it, or even what some of it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To view the source code download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.src_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life.src&lt;/a>
, to download the finished program download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am actually surprised I was expected the code to be much worse than it was, I am not saying it is good, but I can see more than one method and I can’t see any code that obviously is repeated. I can see some terrible variable names. Note to future self don’t use tmp676_674!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming that I wrote this in 2004 what would I have been doing then? It was before I started working in IT. (Hard to imagine I know!) It may even have been before I started living with Keith, before he recruited me for my first IT role. I think I was probably working as an administrator for Defra at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we put 2004 in technical terms, it was before I joined facebook, Office 2003 and XP would have been installed on my PC, and probably felt brand new.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Great British Code Off</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/great-british-code-off/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/great-british-code-off/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/logo.jpg" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Great British Bake Off and The Great British Sewing Bee are very popular TV shows. Each week the contestants take part in a baking or sewing challenge and the judges choose the best and the worst, with the worst having to leave. This is very entertaining as you watch the drama between the contestants and the reactions as the judges tell them they are rubbish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Could this simple format be applied to computer programming? I think it could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only developers I know argue about the best way of tackling different problems, despite being friends. I am going to assume that this is typical behaviour and not unique to them. So for this TV show, we will split the contestants into pairs, that way we would get the added drama of how well they work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still undecided if the pairs stick together each week with one pair leaving or if we randomize the pairs with one person leaves. The second option would cause there to be a group of three every other week, not sure if this would be a benefit or a curse for that group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friends who are experienced programmers have agreed to be the judges, they both have experience of hiring and firing people, know what to look for in good code, and never agree so should be entertaining enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the bake off the contestants don’t really know how well they have done until the judges cut into their cake and take a bite. For the code off we could not compile the code until the judges run it, would make coding extra difficult as if the contestants are anything like me, I run my code every five minutes to see what affect that change has made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what challenges can we come up with?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Web Design week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stored Procedure week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mobile App week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loops&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Logic problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bugs weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performance issues&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I think we are onto a winner here. What does everyone else think?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Podcasts</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/podcasts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/podcasts/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while now I have been listening to podcasts. For those that don’t know a podcast is an audio file that you can download and listen to, usually about a topic you are interested in. The topics that interest me are obviously Star Trek, Science and Technology and IT stuff. I mainly listen to them in the car when I am driving, but sometimes it will be at home when doing jobs around the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the first podcast I listened to was &lt;a href="http://www.trekmate.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trekmate&lt;/a>
. Trekmate as the name suggests is about Star Trek, it’s a few guys talking about Star Trek. It’s very similar to those conversations you have in the pub with your mates. Trekmate do lots of podcasts, one for almost every flavour of Star Trek out there, I don’t keep up with all of them, but the ones I listen to I really enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favourite podcast that is work related is &lt;a href="http://www.runasradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RunAs Radio&lt;/a>
. If you are a SysAdmin or have an interest in servers or IT you should listen to this. The host Richard Campbell interviews IT experts about a particular piece of technology, one week it will be Exchange, the next Security, and then SQL Server. Often I will learn something that I will want to try out, some weeks I won’t learn something specific but will give be an insight into which way IT for businesses is going. I think it was probably only after listening to RunAs Radio that are started having more of a long term plan for my IT infrastructure at work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I have blogged about before I am learning Development so obviously I listen to &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET Rocks&lt;/a>
. This is hosted by Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell (yes the same guy that does RunAs Radio) who talk to developers about code, learning and IT from a more Developer point of view. This is released 3 times a week so is a bit hit and miss sometimes, but most weeks there will be something relevant to me or worth listening to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago I am did something for the first time, I was a guest on one of the Trekmate pods, TenForward. I reviewed 5 Star Trek episodes. This was a bit of a leap for me as an introvert I don’t like to be the center of attention and I certainly don’t like how my voice sounds recorded. Hopefully when released people will like it and I will do lots more of these in the future. Once it has been released I will put a link up here so you can all have a listen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pair Programming</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/pair-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/pair-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I have been working through the challenges on the &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freecodecamp&lt;/a>
website and one of the unique things that this site does is give you the chance to program with another person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am an introvert and if you were to ask me to pick up the phone and ring someone I will procrastinate a lot before doing it (if I do it at all), I also am not good at speaking with strangers but I have been enjoying the pair programming I have done so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have only pair programmed a couple of times so far, so I am no expert. The first time was with someone from North America, it was weird to begin with talking to your computer and hearing an american voice respond, but you soon forget that as you concentrate on the problems you are working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second time was with someone from the Netherlands. This time we tackled some trickier problems. Both times I took more of a back seat but I think contributed useful stuff and I certainly learnt a lot from the other person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that is the key thing about pair programming, you learn so much about how to look at a problem from another angle, or learn about a function you haven’t heard of before. If you are reading this and it was you that I pair programmed with a big thank you for spending the time with me, I learnt a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was trying to pair program again tonight but technical problems prevented me. One problem I have found is finding a partner, was hoping to do some yesterday but no one else was around to partner with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would be interested to learn what companies use pair programming. I imagine a pointy haired boss would say why pay two people to do one job, when you could get them working on different things. However if you want to build up your team and give them loads more skills then pair programming would be great. I also think there are probably some problems that are crying out for pair programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Javascript progress</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/javascript-progress/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/javascript-progress/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got excited earlier this week as I started playing around with the javascript I have been learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I would try and create useful javascript that could be applied to an online filestore. Somewhere that you could upload, delete, edit files and folders and various options to do with your files would popup via javascript or jquery code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I have created a static HTML page which lists a few dummy files. I have added a button which adds a new row into my table and I have used jquery to highlight any selected files and also when the mouse passes over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to follow my progress I have put my files on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/CodeSamples/tree/master/clouds-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
. It’s very basic stuff and I have already got a few lines I would like to refactor but not bad for an evenings work. I have lots of feature ideas to add to this page which should help me learn the basics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trouble with learning all this javascript is that I am starting to get all my programming languages confused. Earlier this week I started writing a for loop in javascript, only problem was I was working on an MS Access ADP (Don’t ask!) which requires the code in VBA. That is never going to work. Oh well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anyone knows good ways to stop myself getting my programming languages all confused do let me know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/hello-world-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/hello-world-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first program anyone writes in a new language is often really simple and just displays the text “Hello World!”, below are a few examples from languages I have knowledge of.&lt;/p>

My new years resolution is to do more coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over Christmas I thought I would have a go at &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.codecademy.com&lt;/a>
I completed the javascript course and I was just wondering what I should try next when I saw a tweet about &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.freecodecamp.com&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then I have been addicted to doing the exercises that they have, almost everyday I have made a bit of progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this site is not just about teaching you how to code, it has an active forum where you can ask questions and understand more about what it takes to become a developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I started these exercises I didn’t know much javascript or jquery but I am starting to learn quite a few commands that hopefully I can put into use at some point. Whatever development I end up doing I am sure I am going to need javascript at some point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the tips I have learnt is that you need to practise daily. Did you ever use flash cards to help pass exams? Well there is an electronic version of them now called Anki. Just add a question/answer pair to your deck of cards and review them each day, the ones you find difficult you review more often than the ones you have learnt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully I can keep this up and later in the year I will be well on way to writing lots of useful code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back at 2014</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/looking-back-at-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/looking-back-at-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>As today is New Years eve I thought it would be a good chance to look back over the last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tangle.jpg?resize=300%2C256&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the start of the year I finally got agreement for the installation of a 30MB leased line. This was an amazing achievement as I had been really struggling to keep everything working on our ADSL connections and the complexity of the connections was starting to cause problems itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However it was not a smooth process, the site survey revealed a substantial installation cost would be required, however the Council was about to launch a voucher scheme that would give us £3000 off. So most of this was just waiting around for the Council to get things going. By April we had it installed and I have been very happy with the ISP we chose, York Data Service (YDS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also during April this year was the end of support for Windows XP and Office 2003. This didn’t impact us too much, mostly due to my constant nagging of the directors to replace our oldest machines. We now only have a couple of machines still running XP and no machines running Office 2003. Most machines are now running Windows 7, I have one Director running Windows 8 for presentations and a few surveyor tablets running windows 8 as well. Like many businesses I am waiting for Windows 10 next year before doing any more substantial replacement of OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In May it was decided that I would move more into development work, so I got a new desktop PC and Visual Studio. I am very happy with my new machine (subject to dell fixing a problem later today) So far I have only dipped my toe into development work, this is largely due to needing more time to build up others to do what I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In June I made another huge achievement. I got agreement for a new server. This was our first Server 2012 server and allowed us to make huge strides towards virtualizing our services. Once we had this server up and running I was able to decommission two of our Windows Server 2003 machines well before it goes out of support next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a huge fan of this new server, I have only used a fraction of its memory. Hyper V is really great and I hope to make progress next year into HyperV replication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also during 2014 we made huge progress with our clouds software. Within the last few weeks it is running on the Azure platform which will not only make it far easier to expand and create new features it will provide us with cost savings. I am looking forward to learning more about Azure as I get deeper into development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow I achieved a lot didn’t I, on top of this I hired a new IT person and trained him up (still more to do), I have also fixed lots of printers, websites, servers (had a server motherboard die!), and made hundreds of changes to our internal databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know what is in store for 2015. I expect a lots of the same with hopefully more focus on developing in Visual Studio, training myself and my department and getting the last few tweaks into our internal servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would also like to thank everyone that I have worked with over the last 12 months (you know who you are), as you made a lot of what I have just described possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Developer Quiz</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/software-developer-quiz/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/software-developer-quiz/</guid><description>&lt;p>Moving house, lack of internet and lack of inspiration has caused a lack of posts recently but hopefully more to come. Been doing some filing and found an old software developer quiz. Thought I would have a go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zogface">Keith&lt;/a> for originally writing the quiz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Questions:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a function that determines the area of a circle given the radius&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add up all the values in an array of integers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Given a table called &amp;ldquo;Nodes&amp;rdquo; with the following structure and sample data (see below after questions):
…where ID is the primary key,andParentID references ID, complete the following:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>write a stored procedure to return all nodes beneath a given node ID&lt;/li>
&lt;li>describe how you might write a query to return all nodes at any depth below a given node ID (i.e. recursively)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a function to get the prime numbers up to 1,000,000&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ve been given the following code to review (below table)– what comments would you give back to the developer?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>ID&lt;/th>
&lt;th>ParentID&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Name&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Type&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Depth&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;p>What’s with that? Why am I in a programming mood when I have boxes to pack and shelves to take apart?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the last few weeks I have been too busy with other things to do much programming or when I had the time I felt more like relaxing than learning anything new.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do I get into the programming zone, what was it about this particular weekend that made me want to? Was it just the fact I had no time to concentrate on it, or is there some more useful factor that controls my desire to code?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can think of a few factors that I should make note of.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Peace and quiet – Friday night I had the place to myself so I could concentrate and do whatever I wanted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideas – Before I started I had some ideas, why don’t I try doing x. Once I have a coding idea I need to investigate it and see where it goes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break from routine – Friday night was the start of a whole week away from work, this gives me more time to forget about the daily stress of the office and think about other things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals – Work annoyed me on Friday and if I want to achieve my goal of working in development more then I need to work at it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I am not sure how I can put these into practise so that I spend more time on development but we will see. One thing I want to achieve in my new home is a quiet place to concentrate and think without distractions, I have a few options which I will investigate over the next few weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway need to get back to packing boxes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To boldly go where no SQL has gone before Part 2</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s continue looking at a database schema for storing details of every Star Trek Episode. If you are new to databases, a schema is just the design of the structure of the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have three tables, Episode, EpisodeWriter and Writer. See my last post for more details of these. It has been suggested that a slight change to this structure would enable storage of more of the creative staff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets rename Writer and call it Credit, and rename EpisodeWriter and call it EpisodeCredit. Now any creative staff member involved in an episode can be stored in the Credit table. Lets alter EpisodeCredit and add an extra column called CreditType. CreditType is just a text field that stores the role that creative person had on that episode, it can be anything from Director, Writer, Actor, Science Consultant etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case anyone wants to recreate the databases I have described here, I have saved the SQL on a separate page which can be found here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We now have the ability to store information relating to the episode in the episode table and any creative people in the credit table. What else can we add to the database? How about a table that can be used to record when an episode was last watched. I am probably weird but sometimes I want to watch a Star Trek episode that I like but I haven’t watched in ages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last watched table is really simple and just have a datetime field and episodeId. This can be further expanded to have a userId field if you wanted to keep track of what episodes your friends had been watching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another idea could be to tag episodes with certain themes or topics like Klingon episodes or meaning of life episodes or Kirk talks a computer to death episodes. Again this is fairly simple table containing TagName and EpisodeId.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To boldly go where no SQL has gone before</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before/</guid><description>&lt;p>My last post proved quite popular so I am wondering if I can combine a post about IT and Star Trek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years ago I used to have lists of Star Trek episodes, which included such information like original air date, production number, episode title and brief description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that was hard to keep track of was how many episodes were written by a specific person. This is because episodes are written by multiple people. A column called writer would then need to contain multiple people, another option would be to have columns called writer1, writer2 etc. This wouldn’t help either as you wouldn’t know which column a specific writer had been saved in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/manytomany.jpg?w=559&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The relationship between writer and episode is known as a many to many relationship. An episode can have many writers and a writer can have written many episodes. To achieve this structure in a SQL database you will need three database tables as it is not possible to create a many to many join between two tables. The first table will contain all the episodes, the second table will contain all the writers, the third table known as a junction table, will contain the relationship between the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s do an example so we can see how this would work. Gene Roddenberry creator of Star Trek wrote the pilot episode ‘The Cage’. So Gene would be added to the writers table with an id of 1 and The Cage would be added to the episode table with an id of 1. In the junction table, it has two columns episode and writer, so we would enter 1 and 1 into these columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Select&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">from&lt;/span> Episode e
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Join&lt;/span> EpisodeWriter ew &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">on&lt;/span> e.id &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> ew.EpisodeId
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Join&lt;/span> Writer w &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">on&lt;/span> w.id &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> ew.WriterId
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But if Gene Coon and Gene Roddenberry had writing credits on The Cage we would need to add Gene Coon to the writing table and add an extra entry to the episodewriter table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to do more posts based on this as I expand the database structure to include other information, I may go on to create stored procedures for bringing back certain information or I may use this as an example to talk about coding a user interface.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is the difference between Development and Operations?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/what-is-the-difference-between-dev-and-ops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/what-is-the-difference-between-dev-and-ops/</guid><description>&lt;p>I want to learn Development and eventually move into a development role. But what is the difference between development and what I already do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put simply Development or programming is the creation of new programs, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IT Operations or System Administration is the administration of existing servers, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been doing System Administration since I started my job back in 2006. What you do as part of this role can be very simple like setting up new users or computers to something very complex like upgrading the version of Exchange that the company uses for its emails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of my role I have done a lot of tasks that could be described as development. I have created databases and built new database structures like tables, views and stored procedures. I have also assisted the development department with testing, setting up visual studio, building websites and databases from code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I describe myself as a developer? I would say yes, I have done plenty of work that is development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I get a job as a developer? Possibly but it would depend on the role. I have many of the skills that developers use, but I have limited knowledge in many areas. What I need to do is concentrate my efforts onto the development work I do and delegate as much administration work as I can so my knowledge can increase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Buzz word in IT at the moment is DevOps. I have lost count of the number of times .NetRocks or RunAsRadio have mentioned it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DevOps is the integration of IT Development and Operations, it emphasises the need for the two departments to work closely together to achieve common goals. In big companies the two departments can pull against each other if you are not careful, but in my case as I do both roles, it would be very difficult for the development side of myself to blame the operations side of myself for a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This I think puts me in a good position, I just need to learn more development and I will make a valuable addition to someone’s development team.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
