&lt;p>My development environment has typically required installing SQL Server. SQL is a bit of a beast with lots of options and takes time to setup how you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However since Microsoft have now created a version of SQL Server that runs on Linux you can run SQL Server in a Linux container with only a few commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to assume you already have Docker for windows installed on your development machine. If not head over to &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#where-to-go-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker&lt;/a>
and find out how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Microsoft guide to setting up SQL Server in a Linux container can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need to download the image. In a powershell window run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This downloads the latest sql server image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To run this image run the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1433:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run a SQL Server image you are required to accept the terms and conditions and set a default sa password. These are added as environment variables with the -e flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also need to set the ports that your container will run on (1433 is the default SQL port) and give your container a name, in this case &amp;ldquo;sql&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have already installed SQL Server you will not be able to run the container on the same port as your local install. To solve this you can select a different port.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1434:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>-p 1434:1433 maps the 1433 port on the container to port 1434 of your local environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have run this command you can connect SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to (local) or (local),1434 if you are using a different port using the credentials you provided and execute any SQL you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your development environment requires windows authentication this of course is not for you, if it doesn’t you are good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The development environment I have been using has various powershell scripts for setting things up. These assume windows auth. However I have adapted them to take custom credentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$credential = Get-Credential $server.ConnectionContext.LoginSecure=$false
$server.ConnectionContext.set_Login($credential.UserName)
$server.ConnectionContext.set_SecurePassword($credential.Password)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The Get-Credential command creates a dialog where you can enter SQL credentials, this is then stored in a variable and used in the rest of the script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do I restore a backup file to my container?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker exec -it sql mkdir /var/opt/mssql/backup
docker cp database.bak sql:/var/opt/mssql/backup
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This creates a backup folder and copies a backup file from your local environment to the container. You can then use management studio to restore the backup file (or you could write a sql script to do it). One thing to note when restoring databases, make sure the files are restored to Linux locations not windows locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only issues I have encountered so far are the lack of support for SSIS packages and no windows auth. There are sql server windows images available which I haven’t tried yet which may work better with some of these options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows Update – don’t turn it off!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/windows-update-dont-turn-off/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/windows-update-dont-turn-off/</guid><description>&lt;p>No blog post this week.

&lt;p>I am probably fairly unique in that I like installing updates whether it be on my phone, my PC or for one of my favourite programs. One of my tasks when I used to work in a sysadmin role was ensuring all windows updates got installed on all servers and client machines. It was a never ending task, as soon as you got almost all updates done, it would be update Tuesday and a new set of updates would be released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can think of a couple of times an update got installed that caused a problem and needed to be rolled back. However I have no way of measuring how often it fixed a problem or improved the security of the OS or other software. If you compare the annoyance of waiting for updates to install against having a computer (or worse a server) be hacked or otherwise compromised I think it is fairly clear what you need to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As someone who works in IT I feel it is my duty to share the importance of keeping your devices updated. Don’t turn automatic updates off or disable it. It is there to help you and keep your computer safe and secure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows 9 or do I mean 10</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/windows-9-or-do-i-mean-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/windows-9-or-do-i-mean-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Like many systems administrators I watched as the news came out yesterday about the latest version of windows. What would it be like? What would it be called? Would it be better or worse than previous versions?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was shocked when the name of the new operating system was revealed to be Windows 10. What really!? At first I though someone had tweeted a photoshopped image of the press conference, but no it was really going to be called Windows 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Windows 10" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/windows_10_fullwidth.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows 10 is the next operating system to be released after windows 8, many had been calling it windows 9 or windows Threshold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft has never had a fixed naming convention for its OSes, so should we really be that surprised at its new name.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Windows 1.0 (1985)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 2.0 (1987)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 3.0 (1990)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 95 (1995)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 98 (1998)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows ME (2000)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows XP (2001)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows Vista (2007)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 7 (2009)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 8 (2012)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 10 (2015)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Windows 11 (2021)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One reason Microsoft may have gone with with Windows 10 is because they wanted to signify that the coming Windows release would be the last “major” Windows update. What does it mean to be the last major update?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look at the list of OSes above you will see that between XP and Vista was a huge 6 years, this gap is/has caused a huge headache for IT professionals (me included). Software was written for XP because that is all that was available, when XP moved out of support earlier this year it caused loads as problems as people tried to get this software to work on more modern OSes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If windows 10 is around for a long time we may end up with a similar situation to XP, in that loads of software will run only on it and cause problems if you try and port it to whatever comes next. I am only a trainee developer so I don’t know what is involved with building an OS, but I would imagine there must be things that are very difficult or almost impossible to fix without ripping them out and starting again which is what happens when a new version of an OS is written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only time will tell if Windows 10 really is the last version of windows and what will happen to the OS in the future. What ever the case I am downloading a preview so I can have a look (I want my start menu back!)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
