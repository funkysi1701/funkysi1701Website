That episode aired May 1994. The newest Star Trek TV show Star Trek Picard has just aired its first episode and this is 25 years and 8 months after that episode. This article may contain minor spoilers for the first episode of Star Trek Picard, you have been warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it would be interesting to compare the two time periods.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fate-of-picards-crew">Fate of Picards crew&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#fate-of-picards-crew">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In All Good Things&amp;hellip; all of Picards crew are still alive except one. Deanna Troi passed away but it is never revealed how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Star Trek Picard, we know Data has died as featured in the feature file Star Trek Nemesis. From the trailers we know Riker and Troi are still alive. We do not know the fate of Crusher, LaForge and Worf yet, but I am going to assume they are still alive somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In both timelines we have one dead crew member.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="living-arrangements">Living arrangements&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#living-arrangements">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In both time lines Picard is living in France at his vineyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In All Good Things&amp;hellip; we do not know who Picard is living with, it is assumed he lives alone, which is why Geordi feels the need to check on him, once he learns about his Irumodic Syndrome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Star Trek Picard we learn that Picard is living with a Romulan couple, due to the involvement Picard made to save the Romulan people when their star went supernova. Picard appears older but for the most part in good health, he can&amp;rsquo;t for example run up a flight of stairs (he is 92 so not surprising really!) and is plagued by dreams from his past.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="romulan-neutral-zone">Romulan Neutral Zone&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#romulan-neutral-zone">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In All Good Things&amp;hellip; there is no Neutral Zone, the Romulan empire has been taken over by the Klingons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Star Trek Picard one would assume there is no Neutral Zone as well because the Romulan star system was destroyed. A handful of Romulans survived mostly due to the actions of Picard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="looks">Looks&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#looks">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we have seen Patrick Stewart does not appear to be ageing. Below is a comparison of how he looks in the two time frames.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I really enjoyed the first episode of Star Trek Picard and it is going to be interesting seeing what other similarities and differences there are between it and All Good Things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Picard is back!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/picard-is-back/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/picard-is-back/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has just been announced at the annual Star Trek Las Vegas (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/STLV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#STLV&lt;/a>
) convention that Patrick Stewart is going to return to his role as Jean-Luc Picard in a new TV Show.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe type="text/html" width="662" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCKQp1sGVRQ?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>Few other details have been announced other than the TV show will take place 20 years after the film Star Trek: Nemesis and will feature the character of Jean-Luc Picard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets run though a few things I would like to see from this new show.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="low-on-action">Low on Action&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#low-on-action">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Star Trek: Discovery is a great show and has brought Star Trek back to our TV shows. However it is an action show, it zooms along so fast and with so much action I would appreciate a show that can takes its time a bit more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want a show that can show Picard carefully considering some moral issue and making a decision. Something we were used to seeing on TNG.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="feature-picards-excellent-speeches">Feature Picard’s excellent speeches&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#feature-picards-excellent-speeches">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the best features I can think of Jean-Luc Picard is his ability to make speeches about one issue or other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Insurection&lt;/strong> : Picard speaks about the forced relocation of a group of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How many people does it take, Admiral, before it becomes wrong? Hmm? A thousand, fifty thousand, a million? How many people does it take, Admiral?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>First&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Contact&lt;/strong> : Picard is hell bent on revenge for what the Borg have done to him and refuses to destroy the Enterprise to save his crew.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I will not sacrifice the Enterprise. We’ve made too many compromises already. Too many retreats. They invade our space and we fall back. They assimilate entire worlds, and we fall back. Not again! The line must be drawn here, …this far, no further! And I will make them pay for what they’ve done.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Measure of a Man&lt;/strong> : Picard argues for the rights of Data.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You see, he’s met two of your three criteria for sentience, so what if he meets the third. Consciousness in even the smallest degree. What is he then? I don’t know. Do you? (to Riker) Do you? (to Phillipa) Do you? Well, that’s the question you have to answer. Your Honour, the courtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product, the truth for all time. Now, sooner or later, this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regard this creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people we are, what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroom and this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagely curtailing them for others. Are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after him to servitude and slavery? Your Honour, Starfleet was founded to seek out new life. Well, there it sits. Waiting. You wanted a chance to make law. Well, here it is. Make a good one.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="ask-important-questions">Ask important questions&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#ask-important-questions">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We live in uncertain times. There are lots of pressures on today’s world and we need to acknowledge these. Picard is an excellent character to use to ask important questions of the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it mean to be human?&lt;br>
How should we treat people that are different to us?&lt;br>
How should we react to extremism?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deal-with-his-age">Deal with his age&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#deal-with-his-age">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the last episode of TNG a future version of Picard is shown 25 years into the future. This is a similar time period so it will be interesting to compare the two. Have Picard look back on his life and ask questions about his life choices.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="be-consistent-with-his-past">Be consistent with his past&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#be-consistent-with-his-past">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Picard is a well known character. So writers please don’t change him. I want a character we know, not a character that looks like Picard but acts in a way contrary to what we would expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Picard has a history we know, he served on the stargazer and of course the Enterprise, he has an artificial heart, he was assimiliated by the Borg. All&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reference-50-years-of-star-trek">Reference 50 years of Star Trek&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#reference-50-years-of-star-trek">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discovery and Enterprise are TV shows which have a problem. There is Trek going on after them which imposes a few rules on what can and can’t be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a TV Show that will take place after every other Trek TV and Film and can do whatever the creators want. This gives freedom, but it also gives the responsibility to reference what has gone before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Picard" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/download.jpg?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2009 Star Trek film features the destruction of Romulus and Spock travelling back in time. How about Picard dealing with surviving Romulans helping rebuild their society, continuing the work that Spock started in the TNG episode Unification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I look forward to finding out what the Star Trek production team has in store for us. If they have Patrick Stewart convinced I am sure it is going to be good.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
