&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the syntax for BASIC, luckily I have been able to find the &lt;a href="http://elborg.dk/books.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manual&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the commands are listed inside so lets see what we can do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx presents you with a command prompt in which you can type text. Back in the 80s we had a tape player to load programs from tape, however I don&amp;rsquo;t have one today so only programs I write can be run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRINT - To write Hello World, you can just type PRINT &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; and Hello World appears on the screen. To Write a program that displays Hello World, you just write the line number first.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 PRINT &amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run this you type RUN
To view the code you type LIST&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Edit a specific Line you can use Ctrl+E and type the line number, or you can just write the line out again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CLS - This command clears the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INPUT N - stores text typed by the user and stores it in the variable N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GOTO N - Execution of code continues at Line Number N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Program I wrote with a bit of help from my boys.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 CLS
20 PRINT &amp;#34;What is your Age?&amp;#34;
30 INPUT N
40 IF N&amp;gt;5 AND N&amp;lt;41 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a good age&amp;#34;
50 ELSE IF N&amp;lt;6 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a spaceman&amp;#34;
60 ELSE IF N&amp;gt;40 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>My 4yo didn&amp;rsquo;t like being &amp;ldquo;too young&amp;rdquo; in the original version, so my 6yo helped me change him to be a &amp;ldquo;spaceman&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not bad and it was fun pair programming with a 6yo, all my typos were quickly spotted, and he easily understood the logic of IF/ELSE/THEN statements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx comes from 1983 and has just 96k of memory. I am very lucky it actually still works, however I have been able to find an emulator so I can write Lynx BASIC from the comfort of my laptop. &lt;a href="https://jynxemulator.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jynxemulator&lt;/a>
, it is also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonathan-markland/Jynx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the ROMs so getting from the website is a better option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The developer experience today is so much nicer than it must have been in the 1980s, however back then distractions must have been much reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No internet or google to get answers to your questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Copy/Paste of text&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Load/Save (unless you have a working disk drive or tape player!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No IDE&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Build or Release process just type RUN&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fathers Day</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/fathers-day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/fathers-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the UK today is Fathers Day. Happy Fathers Day Dad!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I might talk about how he encouraged my interest in technology, especially as in about 8 weeks I will become a parent and will have someone to encourage and inspire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to sound really old but when I was born there was no internet, no mobile phones and computers more often appeared in sci-fi than in your home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first computer I remember us owning was a Lynx. A quick google reveals there were a number of different models, I have no idea what we had but here is what I found.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PRODPIC-2926.jpg?resize=300%2C185&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In March 1983 the Lynx 48K was released, in September this was upgraded to 96K. In December 1983 a new Lynx was released with 128K. To put these numbers in perspective on my desktop is an image file that is 123K! The CPU in this computer was rated at between 4 and 6Mhz. (Modern PCs have CPUs around the 1.5Ghz or 1500Mhz)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx we had, didn’t have a disk drive or a mouse. Programs were loaded from audio tapes (Audio tape was a form of data storage that came before CDs where data was stored on magnetic tape, most often used for music) The tapes we had would often get stuck and data wouldn’t load. The answer to this was to fast-forward/rewind the tape or hit the tape on your leg. For some reason this is a memory I still have of my dad hitting a tape on his leg to get a game or something else to load on the lynx. We also had a joystick for playing some of the games. I believe we also had an early thermal printer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My memory of the Lynx is in black and white. The reason for this is that the Lynx was connected to an old black and white TV, it was a special treat when we connected the main colour TV to the Lynx.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a wide range of games for the Lynx, I can remember Jet Set Willy, and Diggerman. But there were also programs which my father had created. The Lynx had a form of BASIC where you can write you own programs and my father spent many hours writing programs for me and my sister. (We actually never realized this at the time)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that as my introduction to computers is it any wonder that I do what I do now? Now what should I do for my child to encourage them in a similar way?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a family we never owned a games console. Not sure if this was a financial or moral choice but it is something I will have to think about. I want my child to be knowledgeable about computers and able to compete in the competitive job market, but I also want them to know about science and nature and to enjoy their childhood. Lots of technology choices to make over the next few years.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
