&lt;p>Usually at this time of year I like to take the opportunity to look back on the last 12 months, highlight some of my achievements and make a few goals for the new year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many of you 2021 has been a difficult year, but it has also been a year of change, and I am in a much better place now than at the start of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To tell you my 2021 story I first need to give you a bit of a history lesson about my career. So, lets fire up your flux capacitor (or Tardis of similar value) and journey back to 2006.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="back-to-2006">Back to 2006&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#back-to-2006">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2006 I got my first IT job. My housemate, who was working as an IT Manager for a small Health and Safety Company, suggested I come work with him. I was currently working an admin job with no idea what to do with my life, so I said yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in October 2006 I joined as a member of the IT Team. I worked mainly on first line support, but as the IT department was small, I learnt about all sorts of IT things, from fixing printers, setting up the CEOs BlackBerry mobile phone with emails, administering active directory, writing SQL queries to swapping tapes for the weekly backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company had many faults which I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss here, but the work was varied, and I was always learning something new so I stayed with the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of 2010, the IT Manager resigned, shortly followed by the rest of the IT department. In January 2011 I was IT Manager, I had no staff, plenty of IT problems and no clue what I was doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was an amazing time for me, I learnt how to interview and hire staff, I learnt more about the different systems we used. It was approximately at this point in time that I switched from being exclusively a SysAdmin to starting to learn Development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had been creating simple websites for a while, mainly using PHP and MySQL. But since I started working in IT I learned more and more about databases, SQL Server and writing T-SQL scripts. I was the companies &amp;ldquo;database guy&amp;rdquo;, so the company naturally asked me to do more and more database work. This led to learning other technologies like MS Access and C# so I could do more and solve more of the company&amp;rsquo;s problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the company was small, and I would always be dragged in to fix SysAdmin problems so I never managed to spend 100% of my time doing development, so in 2016 I moved on to my first full time development job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new job was great, but I kept in touch with my old CEO, Ally and helped out with bits of work on the side, writing SQL queries, updating the odd bespoke application.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="back-where-it-all-began">Back where it all began&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#back-where-it-all-began">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2019 I started formulating a plan to go back to my old job as a contract developer. To my amazement Ally almost bit my arm off to get me back, agreeing to all my terms. So, in the summer of 2019 I started full time as a contract developer, mostly working from home with the occasionally meeting in the office and supporting the business with IT issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My second stint with the company was different than my first, I was able to concentrate almost exclusively on development work. As the only developer I was in full control of development, I decided to use dotnet and Blazor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Late in 2019 I was given advanced warning that the company was being sold. In Feb 2020 the company did get sold, the new owners kept me on to finish the project I was working on but made me a permanent member of staff. In March 2020, the whole company began to work from home due to COVID-19, with parts of the business being furloughed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a difficult time; on top of the stress the whole world was feeling from the global pandemic I was trying to assist with various IT integrations that you would expect when any company gets sold.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="january-2021">January 2021&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#january-2021">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is pretty much where you find me in January 2021. I was working remotely developing internal applications with dotnet/Blazor with the occasional Teams meeting to demonstrate what I had built so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working on your own as a developer is great! You start work and can write code all day. There is no daily stand up, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain what you have been working on, or what challenges you are facing. You don&amp;rsquo;t have any process or formality to follow, only what you impose on yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a build/release pipelines in Azure DevOps, I created pull requests that would kick of a build, run my unit tests, and run some static code analysis. I would glance over my PRs but 99% of the time I would approve them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the greatest weakness of working on my own, no one to suggest ideas of better ways of writing code, no one to bounce ideas off, no one to encourage or be encouraged when I figured out something clever or offer to help you overcome a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="redundancy">Redundancy&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#redundancy">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Mid July I was told that the development function was no longer required, and my job was at risk of redundancy. As I was the only one working in development it sounded very much like a done deal. I had a couple of redundancy meetings to attend and I would need to talk through how various applications worked as part of a handover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest I agreed with the decision to make me redundant. New development work was not coming through, although the users of the applications I had developed loved what I had created, upper management were keen to migrate off these systems and use more centrally managed systems. If I was in charge, I would probably have made a similar difficult decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As soon as I found out I was at risk of redundancy I called up a couple of recruitment agents I had spoken to before. They told me that it was a great time to be looking for a job and immediately arranged some interviews for the next week. I also took advantage of social media and asked on twitter if anyone was looking for developers like me. To my surprise this resulted in at least one interview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I stressed in all my conversations with recruiters and companies I spoke with, was that I was looking for a &lt;strong>team&lt;/strong>. I wanted to work in a team, bounce ideas off others, mentor others, learn from others. This was the most important thing I wanted in whatever my next role was going to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other important things for me was continuing to use Azure or similar cloud technologies. However, I always think that the tech stack and technology can be learnt on the job, tech moves so quickly these days that you have to be constantly learning to stay relevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About two weeks after I first found out about my impending redundancy I contacted (or more likely was contacted by) a third recruitment agency. It was this third one that eventually got me a job, however all three were brilliant, and kept me updated and answered all of my questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next few days were packed with phone calls, interviews, tech tests. I had a lot of different types of companies that I spoke with, from Software Consultancy companies, FinTech companies, Energy suppliers, Legal companies and many others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this time of interviews, I can think of only two in person interviews. The rest made use of Teams, Zoom, Google Meet and even Skype (yes at least one company still uses it for video chats!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The usual way the process went was a conversation with the recruiter about a role after which my details were sent to the company, If the company liked the sound of me an initial informal interview was arranged, after that a second more technical interview was held, sometimes there would be a tech test, sometimes it was more technical questions being asked in the interview. Some companies had more stages that this, but this was what I typically encountered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I lost count of the actual number of interviews I had, but I used a spreadsheet to try and keep it all straight in my mind. The last thing I wanted was to ask a question about the wrong company!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="positive-no">Positive No&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#positive-no">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I got plenty of noes from these interviews, however all were phrased as a positive no. That being they liked me as a person but something about my skill or experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. A friend once described me as an odd mix of junior and senior developer. I agree with that statement, I have a lot of experience in some areas and a real lacking in others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common one was working in a team. Being a lone developer is not good for gaining experience working in a team. However, each time I spoke with companies I stressed that the &lt;strong>team&lt;/strong> was what I was looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another weakness of mine is front end. When I am building something, functionality is more important than getting it looking good. I came from a database and backend start, so it is only natural that I am more at home working on these things. Also, my most recent projects are working with Blazor, which is brand new and few companies are doing much with it yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried really hard not to be discouraged by these noes and that the right company was just around the corner. One no hit harder than most. I had an initial chat with the team of a FinTech Company and then there was a second interview with the CTO which I felt had gone OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From what I had heard it ticked a lot of boxes, the team sounded good, with lots of support and development opportunities and they were moving to the Cloud, so my Azure experience sounded ideal. The CTO liked me and thought I would be a good fit, but I was part way between a junior and a senior, so he had gone away to try and make a bespoke role for me, eventually it would be a no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back, it is easy to see, that this was really encouraging. They tried to create a bespoke role for me! However, at the time all I could think about was all the noes I was hearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-job-for-me">The job for me&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-job-for-me">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>About the same time, I had my initial interview with the company I would eventually accept a role with. I kept being told that there was a tech test to do, but for some reason it never got sent to me, so the interview featured a lot of tech questions and they really grilled me. I came away without much of a sense of if it went well or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, they liked me and wanted me to do a presentation at their office. I am rubbish at public speaking and doing presentations, so I thought I will do this presentation, but it is very unlikely they will like what I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The topic of my presentation was how I upskilled a team on a new project or technology. As a lone developer what an earth could I do for a topic like that? I thought about what I had done to upskill myself on various things, however that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really address the question, as they wanted to know more about what I had done to upskill a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought back to a time when I helped get a largely un-version controlled codebase into source control and automated the build and release pipeline using Azure and Azure DevOps. This involved talking to SQL and data developers so could be a better option for a presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived at the office to do my presentation. First of all, I parked next to the factory where all the forklifts were, I was directed to the correct place to park. Then I tried to go to the wrong building, a very helpful employee helped me go to the correct place. I was introduced to the people who would be interviewing me, one of whom I had worked with in the past, who immediately said you should hire this guy, he is an excellent developer! As introductions go, that&amp;rsquo;s not bad!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion the presentation was bad. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a PowerPoint or similar to go with my talk, so I just waffled on for ten minutes about what I had done a few years back about how I helped get source control being used.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-next-day-i-got-the-job-offer">The next day I got the job offer.&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-next-day-i-got-the-job-offer">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was very surprised to get the offer as I thought I had done so badly the day before they would give me another positive no. I took a few hours to think about it, however all my other applications were either not started or waiting for the next stage, so I was 99% sure I would accept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had no idea what to expect when I started, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really ask many questions at the last interview as I was convinced, I was going to get a no after my presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I worked my notice period and at the start of October I started my new job. My contract only arrived the day before I started, so in the days before I started my mind was making up reasons why the job would disappear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The job started with a two-day induction. Things that were covered on the induction were, mental health, sleep cycles, company values, health and safety and of course a bit of form filling and photocopying passports that you would expect on a first day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#conclusion">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Back when I had been job hunting, each time I stressed the importance of team. The company I had joined had an amazing focus on supporting its staff and getting the best from each other. I had got the best possible fit for the kind of team I was looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually when I start a new job, I get a large dose of imposter syndrome. Now, two months after I started, I can say, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get that this time. Maybe it is how the team functions, maybe it is my level of experience, or maybe its just something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am happy in my new job. There is a lot to learn, both technology and how to work well in this team. But I am supported, there are people to ask question, I am contributing almost from day one. I have already shared a brief talk about my experience with Blazor, which went down better than I expected. I am excited to learn what is next for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have read all the way to here, Thank you! This is my story and I hope you have found it interesting. If you are looking for a new role, I would encourage you to focus on the soft skills you are looking for next, if you concentrate on team like I did, there is a good chance you will land in an amazing team.&lt;/p>

I used to write blog posts but somehow life got in the way. So much has happened this year, lets have a look at my &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2018/lets-see-what-2018-can-do">goals&lt;/a>
for 2018 and see how far we have got with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buy-a-house">Buy a house&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#buy-a-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My first goal for 2018 was to buy a house. Well so much progress has been made with this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We looked at a few houses, and have made an offer, had it accepted and are waiting for the last few things to get arranged before we start arranging to move in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The location we decided upon was &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Thorne,&amp;#43;Doncaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thorne&lt;/a>
. This is about an hour from York where most of our friends are and my wife has lived all her life, and also an hour from where my family live. I have tried my best to balance location and size of property and we think our new home is going to be a good balance but only time will tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a bit of a mammoth time ahead of me getting everything we own packed up and moved to our new home so wish me luck, but we will get there it is just going to be hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-job">New Job&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#new-job">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In June 2018 I started a new job. This was slightly later than I had hoped but I believe it has been worth the wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new job has lots of perks. Finish early on a Friday (1pm), On site canteen, Cool air-conditioned office, Flexible working hours, Part of a big development team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main benefit is that I am part of a big development team. I have a huge list of things to learn both in terms of technology and how large development teams function. The team is about to finish the first sprint that I have contributed to. My contributions have been very small. A bug fix here, a tweak of an API there. But the important thing is that I am making a contribution and learning along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have also started asking questions about deployment and how this could be automated. Something that interests me, especially with the sysadmin and devops background. I have been tasked with learning &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker&lt;/a>
, so expect some blog posts on this topic in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="see-more-of-family">See more of family&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#see-more-of-family">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This one I am going to count as a miss. I have seen family a few times this year, but my efforts have been more on the first two items in this list. Hopefully this will change as things settle down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">Celebrate 5 years of Marriage&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Me and the wife had a great weekend away to celebrate our wedding anniversary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-my-two-children">Celebrate my two children&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-my-two-children">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not happened yet but it is booked and we just need to arrange a few more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have made no effort to do a talk and this is going to be a goal for 2019 I think. Most of the reason is concentrating on the other areas above, but also because I am not a natural speaker and I don’t like stepping out of my comfort zone. But I will do it, I just need to wait for other things to calm down a bit first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="family-holiday">Family Holiday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#family-holiday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We had a great week away at the start of July. The weather was really great (and still is) and we had lots of time doing things as a family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lets see what 2018 can do!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-see-2018-can/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-see-2018-can/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is 2018 so it must be time to think about what my plans and goals are for the new year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buy-a-house">Buy a house&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#buy-a-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="House" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LEGO-Classic-10703-Creative-Building-Box-Yellow-House.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This a huge goal for me. For many years I was content with renting and thought owning my own home wasn’t for me, but then I went and started a family and my career started going in the right direction and my thoughts about this have changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is going to take a lot of work to make this goal happen in 2018. First I need to save enough money for the deposit, which is far from easy with a wife and two children. Second I need to get our current place sorted ready to physically move which again won’t be easy. Third I need to make a decision which will affect where I live for the next 25 years. At the moment I am torn between the size of property and its physical location, I need to balance both of these and meet the requirements from the rest of the family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do think this is an achievable goal so wish me luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="progress-in-my-career">Progress in my career&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#progress-in-my-career">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I need to be careful how I phrase this in case past, current or future employers are reading. I have been working hard at my current role for over a year and I am starting to wonder what is next for me. I am not entirely sure what form this is going to take yet, I have a few ideas on the go and hopefully I can reveal more soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another one that is very achievable, as long as I have it in the back of my mind as the year goes on progress should be made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="see-more-of-family">See more of family&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#see-more-of-family">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I recently missed a family celebration due to the expansion of my own family and it reminded me that there are aunts, uncles and cousins that I haven’t seen in years and it would be nice to reconnect. Also as my own boys get older and are learning to interact it would be great if they could get to know my own family better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t have a clear idea how to achieve this one as it takes two but I am going to make more of an effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">Celebrate 5 years of marriage&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Wow how has it been five years since we got married? At some point in 2018 I will take time out from the usual and spend it with the wife away from the boys. I won’t give away more details as I want that to be a surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-the-birth-of-my-two-sons">Celebrate the birth of my two sons&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-the-birth-of-my-two-sons">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t want to get my boys christened as I would like them to make up their own minds when they are old enough, however I do want to celebrate all that they are with a thanksgiving service. Not sure when we are going to sort this, however it is my hope that it will be soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="family-holiday">Family holiday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#family-holiday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not much of a goal but in the summer I will take time out to spend a week away with the family. In previous years we have done scotland, wales and northumberland. This year I am thinking of somewhere not too far away as Edward is still small, but maybe near where I grew up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A lightning talk is a very short talk or presentation given at a conference or user group. Friends of mine are having lots of success talking about what they know about and I think it might be time for me to have a go. I am not a natural public speaker so this is a step out of my comfort zone, however I am going to start small and see what happens. At the moment I don’t know what my subject or topic is going to be, my suspicion is that it will be devops related as that interest me more but watch this space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back Ten years</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/looking-back-ten-years/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/looking-back-ten-years/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/10-year-term-life-insurance.gif?resize=471%2C314" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next month I will celebrate ten years working at my current job, two weeks after that I will start a new chapter of my life at a new company. Lets take this opportunity to look back ten years at some of the great stuff I have achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2006">2006&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#2006">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2006 I had no IT experience. If you were to ask me where Event Logs could be found I wouldn’t know, and the letters DNS meant nothing to me. I was quiet and shy but hard working. The idea of making IT my career hadn’t occurred to me, this was just a job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started off life doing first line support and compiling health and safety files onto CD-ROMs (known by the company as Eurofiles) with HTML. At the time the company had a mix of Windows 2000 and Windows XP, using MS Office 2003. Server wise I can’t remember exactly but I think two domain controllers, a database server and a backup server using a tape drive. At this point in time I don’t believe I did a lot with the servers but I think the servers were running Windows Server 2005.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As time went on I learnt more and more about what the company did and how stuff worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="nagios">Nagios&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#nagios">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of my early achievements was setting up a nagios server. I have blogged about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/i-love-nagios/">Nagios&lt;/a>
before, but it is a server monitoring system that runs on linux. I am extremely proud of what I have achieved here, no one else in the company had my knowledge of how nagios worked. Initially I even experimented with using a cheap mobile phone connected to the serial port (remember when PCs had these?) to send SMS messages to alert of down time. However this was abandoned when I burned through all the credit on this phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is still used today, and my current team have been shown how to extend the system as the business changes. My philosophy has always been if we have a problem that Nagios didn’t warn us about we need an extra nagios test. These days the nagios web interface is publicly available on the internet so can be checked from anywhere (assuming the office internet is up!) and a mobile app replaces the SMS idea we originally had.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2011">2011&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#2011">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At the end of 2010 the IT Manager resigned, then the Developer resigned and finally the Lead Developer resigned. I was alone. I was IT Manager. I negotiated my first pay rise since joining the company. I was IT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow things were stressful back then. I had so much to learn but somehow I managed. I learnt how to Interview, yes I have employed some clangers along the way, but also some great staff. As well as internal staff I learnt to deal with contractors. We had contractors to help with our internal systems and also contractors to do development work. One thing I have learnt about contractors is that you will always have to chase them at some point to deliver what you are paying them for.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="server-migration">Server Migration&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#server-migration">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Around the start of 2011 our email server started to show its age. Exchange 2003 had a hard limit on the size of its information store and we were rapidly approaching this. Along with an IT contractor I worked to migrate to Exchange 2010, this was a huge project and caused all sorts of issues which we just worked through. Since then I have done other migrations so Windows Server 2012 and also virtualized many servers in 2013.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#bandwidth">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A major limit with our infrastructure has always been the internet connection coming in. For a while we tried to load balance three ADSL connections, but the upload speed was always a limiting factor. It was a major victory for the simplification of our network when we got a leased line installed into our head office, helped by a government grant we gave us free installation. Not content with this I did the same again for our second York office, including the free installation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="learning-development">Learning Development&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#learning-development">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since I started I have always been learning development stuff. But in the past few years I have learnt a massive amount helped largely by two main things. My boss passing lots of my responsibility onto others and dedicating lots of my time to development tasks, and also the opportunity to learn with our outsourced development team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="finishing-off">Finishing off&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#finishing-off">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a few things that have been ongoing that we have wanted to change since I started which I can’t really take the credit for as they are not complete yet, but I am proud as they may be finished in the next few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company stores calendar information in one giant excel spreadsheet, this is being replaced by outlook calendars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our last Windows Server 2003 server and tape drive is being decommissioned. This is the only server that has been running for the entire time I have been here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way the company keeps track of work coming in and who does what is being reviewed. Over the years many people have tried to adapt the old database that one of the directors created in Access many years ago. I did a major overhaul recently to delete unused columns and added extra invoicing functionality. What is needed is a fresh system, maybe a CRM can do everything they want. I wish them lots of luck in doing this as I know it won’t be easy but it has to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2016">2016&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#2016">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are many other projects and pieces of work that I have done that I am proud of. In 2016 I will leave a stable IT department. All clients are on Windows 10 and using Office 2010. We have virtual servers running Server 2012 and are using some great services from Azure to run our SaaS websites. There are of course things I would have liked to achieve, and things I wish I had done differently but on the whole it feels like the right time to move on, especially now long running projects are starting to conclude.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
