If you want to sign up to pluralsight as well use this link &lt;a href="http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4&lt;/a>
to get money off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pluralsight is a website that sells training videos on a wide variety of technical topics. You sign up for a monthly or annual subscription and you can watch over 6000 courses whenever and where ever you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not a big fan of videos as if I am sat in front of a screen I would rather be building something, however I do spend a lot of time listening to podcasts. So I have decided to convert this time to listening to pluralsight videos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we assume that by not seeing the visual portion of the videos you lose out on 75% of the learning (This is just a guesstimate I am not sure what the exact figure is or how you would calculate it). However this is still 25% more learning than if I hadn’t signed up at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I signed up I have listened to over 27 hours of technical videos. These have covered topics like C#, Security, Xamarin, MVVM, Interfaces, Getting Involved and Clean architecture. The number one thing I have learnt is that there is a lot that I still don’t understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said I would like to think that since starting to listen to pluralsight concepts have gone from being unknown unknowns (I don’t know about them and I don’t understand them) to known unknowns (I know about them but don’t yet fully understand them)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To keep track of your learning pluralsight has some tests which you can complete. I am particularly proud of my score on the Azure test which ranks me as an expert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why not check out what you can learn from pluralsight?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ICYMI What does it mean?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/icymi-what-does-it-mean/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/icymi-what-does-it-mean/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while now I have seen ICYMI splattered around the internet. I had no idea what it meant so just ignored it but I have finally had enough and I googled for a definition and I now know what it means.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>ICYMI – In Case You Missed It
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/in-case-you-missed-it-small.jpg?w=400&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

ICYMI is often used on social media sites to indicate articles that you might have missed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software Development is littered with acronyms and technical terms that I don’t always know the meaning of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When reading it is easy to ignore them and try and understand the rest of the article. However there are loads of resources out there that can explain technical terms in a wide variety of different ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have tried to explain a few different terms and concepts on this &lt;a href="http://www.funkysi1701.com/">blog&lt;/a>
. In the process of writing them I often do a bit of research and read a variety of different definitions, some confuse the heck out of me, while others make me go ahh that makes sense now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When reading to learn, don’t be afraid to dig deeper and understand it all, don’t read the same terms again and again not understanding them like I did with ICYMI.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
