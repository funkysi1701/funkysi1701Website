This is more commonly known as a CI (continuous integration) build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More recently I have started playing about with creating my build using YAML files instead of using the web user interface to create my build.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#why">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You may wonder why go to the effort of learning the YAML syntax when you can just create the build in Azure DevOps and then forget about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly it is because the build changes over time and you shouldn’t just forget about it. If something changes over time then you might want to version control it, or look at a previous version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets say you create a pull request that replaces a .net 4.7 web service with a .net core web service. If you have a CI build this PR will fail because it won’t build. If you change the build first any other builds going on will fail. What you want in this case is the build to be associated with that branch or PR. Any builds before you merge this change in will continue to work and any after this change will also work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do you get started with YAML builds? Well the first thing is to make sure that YAML builds are turned on, as I write this I believe they are still a feature you can turn on or off. Have a look in Preview features and make sure they are turned on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next look at any of your existing builds and click the View YAML link. This will show you an example YAML file of your existing build. You could just save this as azure-pipelines.yml and checkin to the root of your project. You can also click the add new build pipeline option, this will give you some templates to start you off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The YAML file consists of a series of build steps usually called tasks, with a few settings before to configure things like parameters or build agents. Detailed docs about the syntax of the file can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&amp;amp;tabs=schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For my mobile app my YAML files consist of downloading nuget packages, building the solution, building specific projects with desired settings, running powershell or other scripts to set things up and finally publishing the results of the build as artifacts so that they can be used in any releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="secure-it">Secure It!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#secure-it">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Avoid committing passwords and secure keys into source control. I have found you can upload secure files via Azure DevOps and then add a download secure files step at the start of your build. This allows the secure file to be used during the build but the contents of the file can’t be viewed by anyone with access to the source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find it often takes a bit of thinking about how to achieve this, but it is usually possible to keep keys and secrets secure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revisiting Team City</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/revisiting-teamcity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/revisiting-teamcity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year I blogged about &lt;a href="http://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/04/01/teamcity/">Team City&lt;/a>
, well I have been looking at it again recently. In that time they have even changed their logo!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start with thinking about what I want my Continuous Integration server to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Check out my code from source control (usually master but all feature branches would be even better)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure specific setting for build&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build my code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build my databases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run any unit tests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Optional) Run deployment to Azure Test/Live site&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There are probably other things I want to achieve but I will start with these six.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Checking out code from source control is something Team City does out of the box, so I can safely say I have done this now. It even monitors a branch for changes and initiates a new check out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Team City allows you to create specific build steps so in theory you can have multiple builds for every variation of settings that you want for your code. I have not tried this yet apart from building with the default config, but I don’t expect it will be too difficult.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have managed to get my code to build with Team City, it took a bit of tweaking the different build steps but wasn’t too difficult. Team City has a visual studio build agent which takes you solution file and does what it needs to. The one problem I have found with this step is that I get errors with my tests if I select a Debug config instead of Release.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Databases are always the problem part of the deployment. So far I have manually deployed my databases but I intend on revisit this step. A &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21555038/how-can-i-execute-sql-scripts-using-teamcity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow&lt;/a>
post suggests that I can run SQL code via Team City in the following way by creating a command line executable:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Command executable: c:&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\P&lt;/span>rogram Files&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\M&lt;/span>icrosoft SQL Server&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\1&lt;/span>00&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\T&lt;/span>ools&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\B&lt;/span>inn&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\s&lt;/span>qlcmd.exe
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Command parameters: -S &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>ServerName&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span> -i &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>PathToSQLScript&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have yet to try this but I am hopefully that it will just work. Dropping a database and restoring a back and then running different SQL scripts is all possible from TSQL, so I should be OK. Watch this space for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Running the unit tests got me stuck for a while. I tried setting it up using VSTest or MSTest neither worked mainly because a config file wasn’t being copied with the test binaries. When I tried using NUnit it just worked. The tests that failed gave me a few config settings to change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have powershell scripts that deploy to Azure websites, I think that these could form the basis of a deployment to Azure. Again the difficult step here may end up being deploying all the different databases to Azure. This is also the riskiest step as I need to connect to live servers which is why I will leave this to last, at the very least I could generate scripts that do a full deployment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That’s it for now. Once I have this all working I will revisit again with details of the database steps as I am expecting a few challenges to overcome. What have you used a CI Server for? Are there other things I want to achieve from a project like this? Why not contact me or leave a comment below&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
