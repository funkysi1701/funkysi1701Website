&lt;p>My development environment has typically required installing SQL Server. SQL is a bit of a beast with lots of options and takes time to setup how you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However since Microsoft have now created a version of SQL Server that runs on Linux you can run SQL Server in a Linux container with only a few commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to assume you already have Docker for windows installed on your development machine. If not head over to &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#where-to-go-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker&lt;/a>
and find out how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Microsoft guide to setting up SQL Server in a Linux container can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need to download the image. In a powershell window run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This downloads the latest sql server image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To run this image run the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1433:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run a SQL Server image you are required to accept the terms and conditions and set a default sa password. These are added as environment variables with the -e flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also need to set the ports that your container will run on (1433 is the default SQL port) and give your container a name, in this case &amp;ldquo;sql&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have already installed SQL Server you will not be able to run the container on the same port as your local install. To solve this you can select a different port.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1434:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>-p 1434:1433 maps the 1433 port on the container to port 1434 of your local environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have run this command you can connect SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to (local) or (local),1434 if you are using a different port using the credentials you provided and execute any SQL you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your development environment requires windows authentication this of course is not for you, if it doesn’t you are good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The development environment I have been using has various powershell scripts for setting things up. These assume windows auth. However I have adapted them to take custom credentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$credential = Get-Credential $server.ConnectionContext.LoginSecure=$false
$server.ConnectionContext.set_Login($credential.UserName)
$server.ConnectionContext.set_SecurePassword($credential.Password)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The Get-Credential command creates a dialog where you can enter SQL credentials, this is then stored in a variable and used in the rest of the script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do I restore a backup file to my container?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker exec -it sql mkdir /var/opt/mssql/backup
docker cp database.bak sql:/var/opt/mssql/backup
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This creates a backup folder and copies a backup file from your local environment to the container. You can then use management studio to restore the backup file (or you could write a sql script to do it). One thing to note when restoring databases, make sure the files are restored to Linux locations not windows locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only issues I have encountered so far are the lack of support for SSIS packages and no windows auth. There are sql server windows images available which I haven’t tried yet which may work better with some of these options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2018 The Story So far</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/2018-the-story-so-far/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/2018-the-story-so-far/</guid><description>&lt;p>Remember me? I used to write blog posts but somehow life got in the way. So much has happened this year, lets have a look at my &lt;a href="https://dev.to/funkysi1701/lets-see-what-2018-can-do-38o1-temp-slug-2157705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goals&lt;/a>
for 2018 and see how far we have got with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buy-a-house">Buy a house&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#buy-a-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My first goal for 2018 was to buy a house. Well so much progress has been made with this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We looked at a few houses, and have made an offer, had it accepted and are waiting for the last few things to get arranged before we start arranging to move in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The location we decided upon was &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Thorne,&amp;#43;Doncaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thorne&lt;/a>
. This is about an hour from York where most of our friends are and my wife has lived all her life, and also an hour from where my family live. I have tried my best to balance location and size of property and we think our new home is going to be a good balance but only time will tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a bit of a mammoth time ahead of me getting everything we own packed up and moved to our new home so wish me luck, but we will get there it is just going to be hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-job">New Job&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#new-job">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In June 2018 I started a new job. This was slightly later than I had hoped but I believe it has been worth the wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new job has lots of perks. Finish early on a Friday (1pm), On site canteen, Cool air-conditioned office, Flexible working hours, Part of a big development team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main benefit is that I am part of a big development team. I have a huge list of things to learn both in terms of technology and how large development teams function. The team is about to finish the first sprint that I have contributed to. My contributions have been very small. A bug fix here, a tweak of an API there. But the important thing is that I am making a contribution and learning along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have also started asking questions about deployment and how this could be automated. Something that interests me, especially with the sysadmin and devops background. I have been tasked with learning &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker&lt;/a>
, so expect some blog posts on this topic in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="see-more-of-family">See more of family&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#see-more-of-family">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This one I am going to count as a miss. I have seen family a few times this year, but my efforts have been more on the first two items in this list. Hopefully this will change as things settle down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">Celebrate 5 years of Marriage&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Me and the wife had a great weekend away to celebrate our wedding anniversary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-my-two-children">Celebrate my two children&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-my-two-children">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not happened yet but it is booked and we just need to arrange a few more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have made no effort to do a talk and this is going to be a goal for 2019 I think. Most of the reason is concentrating on the other areas above, but also because I am not a natural speaker and I don’t like stepping out of my comfort zone. But I will do it, I just need to wait for other things to calm down a bit first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="family-holiday">Family Holiday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#family-holiday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We had a great week away at the start of July. The weather was really great (and still is) and we had lots of time doing things as a family.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
