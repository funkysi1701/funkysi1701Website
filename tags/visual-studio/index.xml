Code reviews help share knowledge between your team members and help catch bugs before they get into production. But how do you get into the habit of reviewing and avoid the we don’t have time to do this mentality?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) has some great options that can help make code reviews second nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#pull-requests">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of source control systems have the concept of pull requests. This is where you request others to review your code usually in a branch and if they approve it, merge it into a main branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create a pull request in VSTS go to the Code section and select Pull Requests. Often VSTS will make a suggestion of what branch to make a pull request for, if you don’t see this just click the New Pull request button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select a branch you want to merge from and a branch that should be merged into (usually you merge into master from a feature branch). Give your pull request a title and description and select who should review your code, this can either be an individual or a group of people. You can also review all the changes that will be reviewed so you can make any last minute changes before it is reviewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you are anything like me you want your code merged in as soon as you have created your pull request and there is nothing stopping you reviewing your own code and clicking approve and merge on your own pull request. However &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/git/branch-policies?view=vsts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branch policies&lt;/a>
is a way around this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="branch-policies">Branch Policies&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#branch-policies">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Branch Policy" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/save-policy-changes.png?resize=599%2C901&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Branch policies allow you to specify how your code gets merged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to the list of branches in VSTS and select branch policy and you will see a whole host of options to customise the merge process. If you do this on the master branch you will not be able to commit any changes to master without it going through a pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first option enables you to select how many reviewers are needed on your code. If no one else works on your project best not setting this, but for everyone else setting at least one person to review your code is a great practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next you can ensure that your pull request is linked to a work item, this helps keep ensure you are actually fixing issues and not just making change for the sake of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check for comment resolution is a good setting to enable. This ensures that if your reviewer has commented about you needing to change this line here, it ensures that you do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enforce merge strategy allows you to choose between fast forward merge or squash merge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Build validation enables the code to be built using a build definition you have configured. This is a great way to check code builds or tests pass before it gets merged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last two options allow you to specify code reviewers and third party external services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to get Zero Code Changes outside of Source Control</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/get-zero-code-changes-outside-source-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/get-zero-code-changes-outside-source-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>Source control is bread and butter for web developers, however not so much for SQL developers and other business people. One of my goals for the coming year is to get the whole of my team using source control processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the arguments against using source control is there will always be a few exceptions where it won’t be used. Lets look at a few scenarios to help make the case for source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario One&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web Dev 1 makes a change in production to fix an issue and doesn’t use source control. Web Dev 2 is working on a new feature and makes use of source control. He is given the sign-off to deploy his new feature and in the process undoes Web Dev 1’s fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management blames Web Dev 2 as they “broke” stuff during the deployment. Web Dev 2 doesn’t understand what happened and Web Dev 1 is oblivious to the entire scenario despite in reality being part of the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario Two&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A SQL Dev works all night to fix a problem. He deploy to production and doesn’t notice a missed where clause due to lack of sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at these two scenarios done with the whole team buying into source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario One&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web Dev 1 makes a change in production to fix an issue and also commits to source control. This takes him an extra 5 minutes (if that!) Web Dev 2 is working on a new feature and makes use of source control. He is given the sign-off to deploy his new feature and in the process merges Web Dev 1’s fix before he deploys to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management is happy with Web Dev 1, nothing is broken and new functionality has made the website better not worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario Two&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A SQL Dev works all night to fix a problem. He deploy to production and doesn’t notice a missed where clause due to lack of sleep, he also commits to source control this takes him an extra 5 minutes (if that!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the morning a colleague looks through the commits made during the night and queries the missing where clause. A fix is made in source control and deployed, management and the client are unaware that a problem was created and fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are simple scenarios but I cannot think of any situation where the outcome would be better to not use source control. These examples assume no continuous deployment, adding this to the system before every team has bought into source control would cause bugs and issues all over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However with a team that is 100% behind source control continuous deployment can achieve an amazing productivity boost. After every commit code could be automatically tested, reviewed by other members of the team and deployed to test environments for further analysis. Only tested code that has been reviewed can get anywhere near production environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said all this there are ways especially on the SQL side to mitigate loosing changes while you work on training individuals and convincing management. Before any code is deployed to production do a schema compare. If you only see changes you have made you can proceed, if you don’t shout at your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code Reviews&lt;br>
Team awareness of what is being changed&lt;br>
History of changes&lt;br>
Smoother Deployments&lt;br>
Automation&lt;br>
Better Teamwork&lt;br>
Diff changes between different versions&lt;br>
Many more&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disadvantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time to learn tools&lt;br>
Remember to commit changes&lt;br>
Technologies that use binary files harder to version control&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQL with Visual Studio Code</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-with-visual-studio-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-with-visual-studio-code/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing SQL queries is typically done with SQL Management Studio (SSMS). However this tool is a bit of a beast so let’s look at how you could use Visual Studio Code instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio Code is a free text editor but it is so much more than just a text editor. VS Code can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com/Download&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work with SQL Server download the mssql extension. Press &lt;strong>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/strong> and then Select &lt;strong>Install Extension&lt;/strong> and type &lt;strong>mssql&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intellisense in Visual Studio Code is brilliant, better than SSMS. Lets look at how to get it all set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new file and set the language type to SQL (Press &lt;strong>CTRL+K,M&lt;/strong> )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open the command palette, &lt;strong>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/strong> and type SQL to show the mssql commands. Select the Connect command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then select &lt;strong>Create Connection Profile&lt;/strong> , this creates a profile to connect with your SQL Server. Follow the prompts to get it all setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look in the bottom right corner of the status bar and you should see you are connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you type sql you will see a long list of SQL code snippets that you could use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-sql-snippets.png?resize=662%2C348&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a snippet to create, and edit it as required. When you are happy press **CTRL+SHIFT+E ** to execute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is basically all there is to it. However this is an incredibly powerful way of working, the intellisense instantly tells you what database objects you can use in your query and there is a wealth of different snippets you can use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When returning data you get a similar view to SSMS but you can save as Excel, CSV or JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SSMS is a very graphical way of doing things, you can double click a table and see its columns or indexes. VS Code relies on TSQL commands but you have access to exactly the same information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information about VS Code and the mssql extension check out &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode&lt;/a>

This annoys me as it goes against the DRY principle (don’t repeat yourself).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Nuget" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nuget.png?resize=300%2C91&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
One possible solution is to write your own nuget packages. You can then add this piece of code to any project you work on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuget.org&lt;/a>
is the public nuget feed where any developer can download nuget packages. You could publish your nuget package here, but your might want to restrict access so better to create a private nuget feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at how we create a nuget feed in Visual Studio. First thing you need to do is install the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Package Management&lt;/a>
extension to Visual Studio Team Services (its free for less than 5 users), this will add a packages section under the build menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you can start using this new feature you need to add a Package Management License in the users hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once that is done you can create a feed. You need to give your feed a name, decide if only members of the current project or everyone in your account should have access to read and contribute to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you have a feed you could use the nuget package command to create a nupkg file and then nuget push command to add it to your feed. A better way is to get Visual Studio Team Services to do all the hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new project in Visual Studio Team Service to house your nuget package. In the build section add an empty build definition. Choose a build agent, I am using the Hosted VS2017. Then add the following steps nuget restore, Visual Studio Build, nuget pack and nuget push.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>nuget restore – this step is only needed if your code depends on other packages. If it depends on other packages that are only in your feed you must specify your feed in the feeds and authentication section.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visual Studio Build – this builds your code like you would in Visual Studio. The only config I made to this step was to specify Release in configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nuget pack – this creates the nupkg file from your built project. In configuration to package specify the same as you specified in the previous step (in my case Release)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nuget push – this publishes to your feed, so of course you need to specify your feed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One last thing to configure is to enable the continuous integration option in triggers. This means whenever you push code all these steps will run and you have a new version of your nuget package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Visual Studio you need to create a *.nuspec file, this contains all the meta data about your nuget package. Let look at an example.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;package&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;metadata&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&lt;/span>$id$&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span>1.0.2&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span>Nuget&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;authors&amp;gt;&lt;/span>Simon Foster&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/authors&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;owners&amp;gt;&lt;/span>Simon Foster&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/owners&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;requireLicenseAcceptance&amp;gt;&lt;/span>false&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/requireLicenseAcceptance&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>An example of a nuget package.&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;releaseNotes&amp;gt;&lt;/span>Release Notes&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/releaseNotes&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;copyright&amp;gt;&lt;/span>Copyright 2017&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/copyright&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;projectUrl&amp;gt;&lt;/span>https://[yourVSaccount].visualstudio.com/nuget/&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/projectUrl&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/metadata&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;/package&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>One last thing to mention is version numbers. You can either change the version number in your *.nuspec file everytime you push changes. This will create stable packages like 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 etc&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However you can use the automatic version number setting in the nuget pack build step. However I have found this only ever creates pre-release packages and I haven’t found a way to upgrade a package from pre-release to stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a really neat way to reuse your code in multiple projects. I have only been looking at this for a few days and I have already extracted code to do with emails, creating excel downloads and database related methods. I suspect that doing this will also have a side benefit of forcing me to create code with fewer dependencies so more code can be turned into a nuget package.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In the Zone</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/in-the-zone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/in-the-zone/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Friday night I had the urge to fire up Visual Studio and tomorrow (Monday) I move house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What’s with that? Why am I in a programming mood when I have boxes to pack and shelves to take apart?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the last few weeks I have been too busy with other things to do much programming or when I had the time I felt more like relaxing than learning anything new.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do I get into the programming zone, what was it about this particular weekend that made me want to? Was it just the fact I had no time to concentrate on it, or is there some more useful factor that controls my desire to code?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can think of a few factors that I should make note of.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Peace and quiet – Friday night I had the place to myself so I could concentrate and do whatever I wanted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideas – Before I started I had some ideas, why don’t I try doing x. Once I have a coding idea I need to investigate it and see where it goes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break from routine – Friday night was the start of a whole week away from work, this gives me more time to forget about the daily stress of the office and think about other things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals – Work annoyed me on Friday and if I want to achieve my goal of working in development more then I need to work at it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I am not sure how I can put these into practise so that I spend more time on development but we will see. One thing I want to achieve in my new home is a quiet place to concentrate and think without distractions, I have a few options which I will investigate over the next few weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway need to get back to packing boxes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
