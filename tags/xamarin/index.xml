&lt;p>We are very close to 500 Downloads from &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play&lt;/a>
and we have recently smashed past 100 active installs, peaking at 116 and even now we are still over 100. I have had 9 reviews (6 x 5*, 2 x 1 * and a 4 *) which averages out at 4 *

Over Christmas I released a UWP version that can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NM2WHNZTNLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store&lt;/a>
. This has currently had 9 downloads and even had a download to windows mobile (someone out there still likes the platform!)

I have a fairly smooth deployment process using Azure DevOps. After every check in of code a build runs which compiles the UWP and Android versions. The build also increments the version numbers that is required to deploy to either of the app stores.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every successful build of the master branch will kick off a release to the Beta track of Google Play. If I am happy I then release to 10% of the Production track, which can then be increased to 100% (or halted). The release to Microsoft Store happens after the Beta track of Google Play. Only reason for this order is that there isn’t a beta area for UWP apps so I want to quickly test change on android before rolling out for windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these steps require confirmation by me before proceeding and often don’t get further than the beta track.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A further development is that I have open sourced the source code to &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/PwnedPass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
do take a look if you are curious or want to contribute. With the purchase by Microsoft there are easy ways to connect github repositories to Azure DevOps. Once I create a Pull Request in github it creates a build in Azure DevOps and all the build and release steps can happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still not 100% sure if I want to keep my bug and issue tracking in github or Azure DevOps as both have features for doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One future improvement I want to make is to automate the creation of screenshots. When I create a new feature and it gets checked in. I would like to automatically created screenshots of the key pages and submit them to the different app stores. Currently I am not sure if this is possible or how to go about it. I have some ideas to experiment with so we will see what I can do.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
