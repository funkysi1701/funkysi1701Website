&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2010 I started by committing the code for an old php website I had created. Then in December I committed some other php sites.&lt;/p>

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between 12 December 2010 and 29 September 2011 I must have created some automated process which is why there is a commit every day. Looking at the diff it appears to be related to tracking visitors to a site. I assume back then I hadnâ€™t heard of the .gitignore file!&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing for a few years until 2014, when I started compiling a code samples collection, this is bits of code that I want to show off, I have added to this since 2015 so I really should go back to this as my skills have developed a bit since then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/git15.jpg?resize=768%2C173&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2015 I really started to think of myself as a developer, I added repositories for Raspberry Pi, and a few C# ideas I had. I ended the year taking part in Advent of Code&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/git16.jpg?resize=768%2C173&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What did I do last year? Well I started going to York Code Dojo and this meant lots of forks from their code examples and also my first pull request. I also did a fair bit of looking at other repositories trying to find a good open source project to contribute to, still not found one for me yet. Lastly I ended 2016 with a bit of Advent of Code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not sure how enthralling a blog post this is, but fascinating to see the different commit histories.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
