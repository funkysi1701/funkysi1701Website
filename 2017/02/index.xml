Today I spent some time learning the R language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem I was trying to solve was to convert local prices of some items into Euros. I had been using a fixed exchange rate for all data, but as exchange rates fluctuate so much this is incorrect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first though was to find a free API that I could query to get the values I wanted. The first API I found didn’t cover all the currencies, the next one I found I burnt through the free allowance in one pass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A colleague of mine mentioned using R to solve this, he sent me some links and I set out to write my first piece of R code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My finished code can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/ExchangeRate/blob/master/script.R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
and I will attempt to explain some of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R defines functions fairly simply&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>nameoffunction &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">function&lt;/span>(arg1, arg2)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> arg1 &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> arg2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have created a function that takes 2 parameters date and currency. I know I have about 10 different currencies that I want to get currencies for and I want to loop through each day so I will need to pass in a date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The source of my exchange rate information is the &lt;a href="https://www.xe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.xe.com&lt;/a>
website, its historical exchange rate page passes currency and date into the query string so I should be able to build up a string containing all the different elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All programming language can concatenate strings and R is no different. R uses paste()&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However R has an annoying feature in this function. I would expect that var in the above example would contain &amp;ldquo;HelloWorld&amp;rdquo;, it doesn’t it contains &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;. Why it automatically adds a space I don’t know?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, sep&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I am not entirely sure what all of the code does but I can take a good guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>read_html() I would guess loads a html page, html_nodes() finds all the html tags of a certain type on the page, in my case &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;, html_table() reads the first table it finds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>table1[2] selects the second column, and head() selects a specific number of rows. I want the first row and second column so I combine these two as head(table1[2],1)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have found my exchange rate what do I do with it? R can read and write to SQL Server so why not store this info in a SQL lookup table. I can then use this data in a stored procedure when I process my data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To query sql you can use sqlQuery(), it has two parameters, a sql connection and a TSQL command (eg a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE statement)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use a while loop to loop through every day between 1st October 2016 and today and look up the exchange rate for each currency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now I am manually running this R script, however there are ways to run R directly from SQL Server which I may well investigate. I could then have a SQL job to run this on a schedule, maybe once a day to get the latest exchange rates. I also would like to do something a bit cleverer like only getting exchange rates for the days that I need them by querying existing database tables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Side Project – Connect 4</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/side-project-connect-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/side-project-connect-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have probably like me almost forgotten about this blog. Life has got in the way over the last few months, but lets see if I can restart my blogging habit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Connect4.png?w=639&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2017 I want to start a side project for a few reasons. I want to improve my coding skills and look at things I wouldn’t normally during my day job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been trying to decide what to build. The actual project doesn’t matter too much, it is the techniques I use during build that matters the most. I would like something that I can start off as a windows app and then extend onto the web or mobile apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started off thinking about a Rubik’s cube app, however my initial coding has lead me to believe it is probably too complex for my first app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year I spent an evening looking at Connect 4 during a &lt;a href="https://yorkcodedojo.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">York Code Dojo&lt;/a>
session. I think this should be complex enough that I can code some logic to efficiently solve the game, however not too complex I get defeated before building too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I have built a console app that displays via Console.Write() commands, a grid to represent the game, with 0 meaning empty, 1 red and 2 yellow etc. I am currently working on the logic to solve the game, once I have that in a good state I can extend into a winforms app, into a web (MVC most likely) app and finally a mobile app (I have no knowledge about how to do this yet, but something I would like to try one day).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the last few days I listened to .NetRocks where they discussed &lt;a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progressive Web Apps&lt;/a>
. This sounds like a great challenge for me to aim for. A progressive Web App is a website that automatically detects various properties to give you an app that runs well whatever the state of your internet connection and whatever browser you are in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have lots to learn but I can split it down into small sections and I can build something that demonstrates some of my skills.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
