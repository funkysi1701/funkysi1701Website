&lt;p>Scratch is a website that allows you to &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; by combining blocks together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how the scratch website describes its self&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Scratch is the world’s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.
Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.
Scratch is always free and is available in more than 70 languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Scratch can be found by going to &lt;a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of the blocks affect your character or &amp;ldquo;sprite&amp;rdquo;, the default is a cute looking cat which may also be the scratch logo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/scratch.png" loading="lazy"
width="905" height="835"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The left hand side of the screen consists of a list of the blocks of code you can use and your coding area where you can arrange them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The right hand side shows the results of your code, where you can run and test what your code does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It didn&amp;rsquo;t take my boy long to code something like this tonight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/scratch2.png" loading="lazy"
width="712" height="725"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This game moves the &amp;ldquo;sprite&amp;rdquo; towards the mouse pointer and a message &amp;ldquo;got you&amp;rdquo; appears on screen when it reaches your mouse pointer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go through all the different blocks you can choose from, but I will highlight some of the programming concepts being learnt here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>inputs&lt;/strong> every computer program needs inputs and there are lots to choose from, things like moving the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>outputs&lt;/strong> your code needs to do something, this code moves a sprite about the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>variables&lt;/strong> my boy hasn&amp;rsquo;t heard of algebra yet, but he is already grasping concepts like variables, where a value can be assigned and maths can be applied to. In this example the score increases&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>loops&lt;/strong> this program keeps looping until it reaches the mouse pointer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>logic&lt;/strong> other logic commands are also available, like if / else statements, also &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; and = statements can be used&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of help and tutorials on the site to help you along, and you can customise the look and even record short sound clips to play in your code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Temporal Trek Podcast</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/temporal-trek-podcast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 18:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/temporal-trek-podcast/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this year I was a guest on the Temporal Trek Podcast.&lt;/p>

This is my second certification exam I have sat after the Azure Fundamentals one I sat last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/3aab54c8-a109-4018-bcad-dbe0d6a1fc0c/public_url">&lt;img src="https://images.credly.com/size/680x680/images/68468004-5a85-4f3b-bc58-590773979486/AWS-CloudPractitioner-2020.png" alt="AWS Cloud Practitioner" width="150" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time was different than the Azure one. Colleagues at work encouraged me to look into doing this particular exam and my employer is going to cover the cost of the exam itself. Last time I did the exam in my own time and didn&amp;rsquo;t really discuss it with anyone from work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other difference was this time I went to a testing centre. The centre was a 5 minute walk from the office. So I decided to work from the office today and 20 minutes before the exam started I walked to the centre. I signed a couple of bits of paper, had my photo taken, had my passport and driving license laughed at, put my belongings in a locker and I was free to start the exam. No worrying about internet connectivity or kids making noise outside my room, or the endless photos at the prep stage of an exam from home. I think I prefer the exam centre experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other difference was the first exam was Azure, this one was AWS. Both exams cover similar concepts, they are both introductions to Cloud Computing. It&amp;rsquo;s ten months since I did the Azure one, however they both had multiple choice questions and gave you the results at the end. I feel overly familir with Azure, while I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that was with AWS yet. A lot of questions relied on you knowing what AWS services are called. eg AWS Pipeline, AWS CodeStar, AWS CodeBuild, Amazon CodeGuru are all AWS services and are easily mixed up, especially as I have only used a few AWS services, while I have used a lot more of the Azure ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My memory is the Azure gave you a breakdown of your score at the end, while I am still waiting for that from todays exam. This difference may of course be due to it being in a testing centre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still prefer Azure to AWS, however today has proven that I can learn AWS stuff as well. For my next exam I want to get more hands on with my learning, as most of the services I have learnt about so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in action.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Updating SQL Server with Docker</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/updating-sqlserver-with-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/updating-sqlserver-with-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p>This morning I was listening to a podcast where the new features coming out for SQL Server 2022 were being discussed. This starting me thinking about what would be involved in upgrading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upgrading production environments is complex and there are licensing considerations to take into account. However for non production workloads like development this isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem so lets look at that first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past I have installed SQL Server Devloper Edition onto my laptop, this is fine but I have found that unless you are very careful you may end up with multiple different versions of SQL Server sitting around, and it is difficult to cleanly remove them without a fresh install of the OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However in this day and age, Docker and Containers are king. My current development environment makes use of Docker and has a docker compose file which sets up SQL Server for this particular application, lets take a look.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">sqlserver&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">image&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">container_name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">Sql&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">ports&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;5432:1433&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">networks&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">my-network&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">volumes&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This defines which docker image to use, in this case 2019-latest, sets up ports and the name and saves the data on a docker volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we then run SELECT @@VERSION on this instance of SQL Server we get told:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM-CU13) (KB5005679) - 15.0.4178.1 (X64) Sep 23 2021 16:47:49 Copyright (C) 2019 Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS) &amp;lt;X64&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>What if we change the docker-compose file to use 2022-latest?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>manifest for mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest tagged by &amp;#34;2022-latest&amp;#34; is not found
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>SQL Server 2022 hasn&amp;rsquo;t been released yet so there is no docker image for it yet. Try this command again in a few months when it is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK so what else can we try? What about a downgrade to 2017-latest? Will that work?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Server 2017 starts but the following error gets logged.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>2022-02-23 21:41:15.30 Server Software Usage Metrics is disabled.
2022-02-23 21:41:15.30 spid6s Starting up database &amp;#39;master&amp;#39;.
2022-02-23 21:41:15.34 spid6s Error: 948, Severity: 20, State: 1.
2022-02-23 21:41:15.34 spid6s The database &amp;#39;master&amp;#39; cannot be opened because it is version 904. This server supports version 869 and earlier. A downgrade path is not supported.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Doh we can&amp;rsquo;t downgrade the existing database we have. Probably a good thing really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft release regular updates for SQL Server called CU&amp;rsquo;s (Cumulative Updates), you can see above we are on CU13. Is there a CU14 or CU15 we could try?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update the docker compose to: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-CU14-ubuntu-20.04&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point I actually got an error&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>2022-02-23 21:50:20.71 Server Error: 17058, Severity: 16, State: 1.
2022-02-23 21:50:20.71 Server initerrlog: Could not open error log file &amp;#39;/var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog&amp;#39;. Operating system error = 5(Access is denied.).
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This is caused by trying to use SQL Server 2017 but it is easy to fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In docker desktop there is a volumes section, find the volume you are using with SQL Server and delete the errorlog mentioned above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Docker Desktop" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2022/docker-desktop1.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you retry SQL will start OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Repeating the SELECT @@VERSION gives us a new CU&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM-CU14) (KB5007182) - 15.0.4188.2 (X64) Nov 3 2021 19:19:51 Copyright (C) 2019 Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS) &amp;lt;X64&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM-CU15) (KB5008996) - 15.0.4198.2 (X64) Jan 12 2022 22:30:08 Copyright (C) 2019 Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS) &amp;lt;X64&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>How much easier is this than manually installing updates and rebooting or attempting to uninstall and reinstall SQL Server. As SQL Server 2022 isn&amp;rsquo;t out yet I can&amp;rsquo;t say for certain what issues I may encounter but hopefully it will be as easier as this. And I don&amp;rsquo;t need to backup or restore and databases they are all available as before!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>dotnet is 20 years old</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/dotnet-is-20-years-old/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/dotnet-is-20-years-old/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today Microsoft celebrated 20 years since the first version of dotnet was released with a special live stream event.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A lot has happened in the 20 years of dotnet (or .Net). It is my understanding that .Net was created to rival Java. When the .Net Framework was first created it was a windows only thing, but today modern .Net is a modern run anywhere platform, with .net applications running everywhere from PCs and Laptops, Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s, Mobile phones and tablets (via Xamarin Forms), to Websites and Microservice APIs running on every Cloud platform out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to celebrate this achievment tweet with the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dotnetlovesme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DotNetLovesMe&lt;/a>
or download some of the digital swag available from &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotNET20th/tree/main/Swag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Thursday the 17th Feb the first preview of dotnet 7.0 is going to be released, with the latest version 6.0 only being released last November.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="History of DotNet" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLj8kj7XEAcW3ng?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=4096x4096" loading="lazy"

Is it to learn new technologies and techniques? Is it to create a following? Is it to educate others? Is it to build some kind of service? Is it some combination of all of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history">History&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#history">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back when the web was young and I was first learning HTML. I hand crafted web pages, adding photos I had taken with captions. If I needed a new page I just added a new html page and linked to it from another page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As time went on I started to learn mysql and php and my website became a hand crafted php nightmare. I also applied what I learned to help my father run the website for his camera club.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point I started playing with WordPress. I have had various WordPress websites or blogs over the years. WordPress is very powerful you can do so many things, install so many plugins. WordPress runs on php and mysql and as my career started to centre around the .net space, I started to want something that was similar, so I could apply things I had learnt to my own website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has led me to the current state of my website. I have a WordPress blog, with most of my oldest content, my newer content lives on dev.to and I have a Blazor webassembly site that uses the dev.to api to run my new website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Blazor webassembly is great, however it has some limitations which I am starting to push against. To host this as cheaply as possible I am using Azure static web apps, so no .net backend all the website is front end. I have some Azure Functions that does the backend bits that I need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google and other bots are not able to find any of my pages except index, due to the way Blazor works. I have got round this by pre rendering the content using &lt;a href="https://prerender.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://prerender.io/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My next difficulty is how to generate a sitemap.xml or a rss feed for my blog. This has started to make me question my architecture decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could use a hosted solution like &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ghost&lt;/a>
which is popular with a some of my peers. This would solve many of the problems I am currently facing but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to play with everything as it is hosted and therefore someone else&amp;rsquo;s problem. How important that is I will look at later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option would be to use github pages, there are quite a few ways to publish a github page, &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo&lt;/a>
appear to be the most popular. Both produce static content and both are a new for me to learn. Interestingly I could also publish either to Azure Static Web apps if github pages ends up not being suitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="split-in-two">Split in two&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#split-in-two">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think my website needs to be split in two. I need a stable blog platform probably using Hugo and github pages. This is what I want to get indexed by the search engines and be the primary way people find out about what I am doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using GitHub Actions</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/using-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/using-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running my website on Azure Static Web Apps for a while and it is pretty cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you create a Static Web App on Azure you get asked for the github repo of your source code and even the branch to use.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Repo for my Static Web App" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/off7ur2tgsla4smkrhhi.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have selected this, you get asked for the type of code to deploy, mine is Blazor Web Assembly but you can use Angular, React or Vue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Actions workflow creation" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ruhzjeujgl1yjxx5lng8.png" loading="lazy"
/>
You now have three variables to fill in the location in your code of the Website, the location of your Azure Functions and the output location usually wwwroot. Once you have set these three you can preview the GitHub Actions file that will be created and added to your repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get something like this&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with github actions, however I have used Azure DevOps quite a bit. Over on the Azure DevOps side I have created a pipeline that deploys to a Dev environment, then a Test environment and finally a production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets have a look at the workflow that I ended up with and with can break down how it all works. Note I am new to Github actions so if there is a better way of doing this do let me know.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The first thing I did was create three Azure Static Web Apps, I am using the free tier so while this is trippling my costs it is all still free! Doing this created three github action workflow files, I deleted two and edited the third, but before I deleted them I made a note of the AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN. If you look in your settings -&amp;gt; secrets for your repo you will see secrets have been created, this is the secure token that github uses to update your static web app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we are in settings we might as well look at environments. I created a Prod, Test and Dev environment that I was going to use in my github actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Environments can have various rules setup on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Required reviewers - this is like an approver, a user specified here must aprove for the workflow to be deployed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait time - I didn&amp;rsquo;t use this, but it looks like a certain amount of time can be set to pause the deployment. (I assume to do some kind of manual check)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployment Branch - specify what branch are allowed to be deployed to what environments. I specified develop, main and feature branches could be deployed to the Dev environment, develop and main could go on Test and main could go on Prod&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Environment secrets - I didn&amp;rsquo;t use this as my secrets were already created, however it looks like your secrets can be associated with a specific environment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now that we have the static web apps setup and the environments lets look at the github action file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all I removed the PR stuff and just concentrated on pushes. I wanted my workflow to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Push to feature branch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Dev env&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PR feature branch to develop&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once merged code gets pushed into develop&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Test env&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PR develop to main&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once merged code gets pushed into main&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Prod env (after approval)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The approval on deploying to production I think is probably overkill, but I still have it setup like that for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My gh action has three jobs defined as dev: test: and prod: they are all the same except they have the azure_static_web_apps_api_token that is correct for their environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also each have a environment defined eg&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>environment:
name: Prod
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Lastly Test and Prod have an if test setup, if the test is false the job won&amp;rsquo;t run. Importantly it won&amp;rsquo;t fail it just won&amp;rsquo;t run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Prod this needs to only run on main branch so we have&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if: github.ref == &amp;lsquo;refs/heads/main&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Test this needs to only run on develop so&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if: github.ref == &amp;lsquo;refs/heads/develop&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could have a test for develop to only run on feature/* but I have allowed it to run everytime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is loads more you can do with github actions, but hopefully this gives you a taste of some of the things you can do. I currently have a mix of Azure DevOps and github actions so I will be working on getting github actions to do more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2022 Goals</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/2022-goals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/2022-goals/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lets have a look at what my goals were for 2021. I had eight of them, lets look at them one by one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Azure certification&lt;/strong>. In May of this year I sat and passed the Azure Fundamentals exam. I am calling this goal as achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mentoring&lt;/strong>. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything about working with others or mentoring, so not sure I achieved this one. However I do now work in a development team and I have been reviewing others code and having my own reviewed. We have a junior developer and I am enjoying the opportunities I have to work with him and share my wisdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>F#&lt;/strong>. I have done zero work with F# in 2021, so this one I didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cosmos db/Mongo db&lt;/strong>. I have worked with both of these technologies in 2021. I used Cosmos the most with my website, and storing data for it. I used Mongo/Atlas for auditing for a project I did for my previous job. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I was expert in either of these, but I am starting to get a flavour of non SQL Server databases. I should also note that I am using mysql a lot in my latest job, so another non SQL Server technology that I get to use on a daily basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Give a talk&lt;/strong>. I said last year that maybe I would make baby steps towards doing this, and I have. In the interview for my new job I gave a short presentation (I thought it was bad, but others didn&amp;rsquo;t!) I also gave a short introduction to Blazor talk which went down well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mandlebrot Generator&lt;/strong>. Did nothing on this one as well. I may have googled the code but that is as far as I got.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pwned Pass Mobile App&lt;/strong>. I got an increase in users in 2021 and hence it it still running and I still pay for the API key. I am still considering what to do with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time for me&lt;/strong>. Achieved this one, had plenty of time for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="not-a-bad-year-but-what-are-my-goals-for-2022">Not a bad year but what are my goals for 2022?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#not-a-bad-year-but-what-are-my-goals-for-2022">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video&lt;/strong>. I have just purchased a green screen, so my first goal is to learn how to use OBS, how to light myself properly without getting horrible reflections. I have the content for my first talk, the talk I gave at work about Blazor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conference&lt;/strong>. Attend an in person conference. I am booked to attend Scottish Summit, however it has been postponed due to COVID-19.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Blog More&lt;/strong>. I have been neglecting writing blog posts a bit recently, so I want to do more.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Metrics&lt;/strong>. I have been recording various metrics from twitter, github etc and I would like to expand this and make it a service.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile Pic&lt;/strong>. My profile pic is getting a bit old, so it would be nice to update the images I use online and improve my personal brand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Back to BASIC</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/back-to-basic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/back-to-basic/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">How exciting my Lynx Computer from my childhood has come home, all 96k of it &lt;a href="https://t.co/aeN38KBiS8">pic.twitter.com/aeN38KBiS8&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Simon Foster (@funkysi1701) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/funkysi1701/status/1475139125154037760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2021&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the syntax for BASIC, luckily I have been able to find the &lt;a href="http://elborg.dk/books.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manual&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the commands are listed inside so lets see what we can do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx presents you with a command prompt in which you can type text. Back in the 80s we had a tape player to load programs from tape, however I don&amp;rsquo;t have one today so only programs I write can be run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PRINT - To write Hello World, you can just type PRINT &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; and Hello World appears on the screen. To Write a program that displays Hello World, you just write the line number first.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 PRINT &amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run this you type RUN
To view the code you type LIST&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Edit a specific Line you can use Ctrl+E and type the line number, or you can just write the line out again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CLS - This command clears the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INPUT N - stores text typed by the user and stores it in the variable N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GOTO N - Execution of code continues at Line Number N&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Program I wrote with a bit of help from my boys.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>10 CLS
20 PRINT &amp;#34;What is your Age?&amp;#34;
30 INPUT N
40 IF N&amp;gt;5 AND N&amp;lt;41 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a good age&amp;#34;
50 ELSE IF N&amp;lt;6 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;a spaceman&amp;#34;
60 ELSE IF N&amp;gt;40 THEN PRINT &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>My 4yo didn&amp;rsquo;t like being &amp;ldquo;too young&amp;rdquo; in the original version, so my 6yo helped me change him to be a &amp;ldquo;spaceman&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not bad and it was fun pair programming with a 6yo, all my typos were quickly spotted, and he easily understood the logic of IF/ELSE/THEN statements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lynx comes from 1983 and has just 96k of memory. I am very lucky it actually still works, however I have been able to find an emulator so I can write Lynx BASIC from the comfort of my laptop. &lt;a href="https://jynxemulator.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jynxemulator&lt;/a>
, it is also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonathan-markland/Jynx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the ROMs so getting from the website is a better option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The developer experience today is so much nicer than it must have been in the 1980s, however back then distractions must have been much reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No internet or google to get answers to your questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Copy/Paste of text&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Load/Save (unless you have a working disk drive or tape player!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No IDE&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No Build or Release process just type RUN&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Comparison of All Good Things... and Star Trek Picard</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/a-comparison-of-all-good-things-and-star-trek-picard/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/a-comparison-of-all-good-things-and-star-trek-picard/</guid><description>&lt;p>The final episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation features a few scenes set 25 years into the future. That episode aired May 1994. The newest Star Trek TV show Star Trek Picard has just aired its first episode and this is 25 years and 8 months after that episode. This article may contain minor spoilers for the first episode of Star Trek Picard, you have been warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it would be interesting to compare the two time periods.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fate-of-picards-crew">Fate of Picards crew&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#fate-of-picards-crew">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In All Good Things&amp;hellip; all of Picards crew are still alive except one. Deanna Troi passed away but it is never revealed how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Star Trek Picard, we know Data has died as featured in the feature file Star Trek Nemesis. From the trailers we know Riker and Troi are still alive. We do not know the fate of Crusher, LaForge and Worf yet, but I am going to assume they are still alive somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In both timelines we have one dead crew member.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="living-arrangements">Living arrangements&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#living-arrangements">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In both time lines Picard is living in France at his vineyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In All Good Things&amp;hellip; we do not know who Picard is living with, it is assumed he lives alone, which is why Geordi feels the need to check on him, once he learns about his Irumodic Syndrome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Star Trek Picard we learn that Picard is living with a Romulan couple, due to the involvement Picard made to save the Romulan people when their star went supernova. Picard appears older but for the most part in good health, he can&amp;rsquo;t for example run up a flight of stairs (he is 92 so not surprising really!) and is plagued by dreams from his past.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="romulan-neutral-zone">Romulan Neutral Zone&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#romulan-neutral-zone">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In All Good Things&amp;hellip; there is no Neutral Zone, the Romulan empire has been taken over by the Klingons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Star Trek Picard one would assume there is no Neutral Zone as well because the Romulan star system was destroyed. A handful of Romulans survived mostly due to the actions of Picard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="looks">Looks&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#looks">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we have seen Patrick Stewart does not appear to be ageing. Below is a comparison of how he looks in the two time frames.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="All Good Things.." src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/all-good-things.jpg?w=584&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed the first episode of Star Trek Picard and it is going to be interesting seeing what other similarities and differences there are between it and All Good Things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lone Developer to Senior Developer, my 2021 story</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/lone-developer-to-senior-developer-my-2021-story/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 09:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/lone-developer-to-senior-developer-my-2021-story/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-day-5-of-the-festive-tech-calendar">Welcome to Day 5 of the Festive Tech Calendar!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#welcome-to-day-5-of-the-festive-tech-calendar">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Usually at this time of year I like to take the opportunity to look back on the last 12 months, highlight some of my achievements and make a few goals for the new year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many of you 2021 has been a difficult year, but it has also been a year of change, and I am in a much better place now than at the start of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To tell you my 2021 story I first need to give you a bit of a history lesson about my career. So, lets fire up your flux capacitor (or Tardis of similar value) and journey back to 2006.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="back-to-2006">Back to 2006&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#back-to-2006">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2006 I got my first IT job. My housemate, who was working as an IT Manager for a small Health and Safety Company, suggested I come work with him. I was currently working an admin job with no idea what to do with my life, so I said yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in October 2006 I joined as a member of the IT Team. I worked mainly on first line support, but as the IT department was small, I learnt about all sorts of IT things, from fixing printers, setting up the CEOs BlackBerry mobile phone with emails, administering active directory, writing SQL queries to swapping tapes for the weekly backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company had many faults which I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss here, but the work was varied, and I was always learning something new so I stayed with the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of 2010, the IT Manager resigned, shortly followed by the rest of the IT department. In January 2011 I was IT Manager, I had no staff, plenty of IT problems and no clue what I was doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was an amazing time for me, I learnt how to interview and hire staff, I learnt more about the different systems we used. It was approximately at this point in time that I switched from being exclusively a SysAdmin to starting to learn Development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had been creating simple websites for a while, mainly using PHP and MySQL. But since I started working in IT I learned more and more about databases, SQL Server and writing T-SQL scripts. I was the companies &amp;ldquo;database guy&amp;rdquo;, so the company naturally asked me to do more and more database work. This led to learning other technologies like MS Access and C# so I could do more and solve more of the company&amp;rsquo;s problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the company was small, and I would always be dragged in to fix SysAdmin problems so I never managed to spend 100% of my time doing development, so in 2016 I moved on to my first full time development job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new job was great, but I kept in touch with my old CEO, Ally and helped out with bits of work on the side, writing SQL queries, updating the odd bespoke application.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="back-where-it-all-began">Back where it all began&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#back-where-it-all-began">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2019 I started formulating a plan to go back to my old job as a contract developer. To my amazement Ally almost bit my arm off to get me back, agreeing to all my terms. So, in the summer of 2019 I started full time as a contract developer, mostly working from home with the occasionally meeting in the office and supporting the business with IT issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My second stint with the company was different than my first, I was able to concentrate almost exclusively on development work. As the only developer I was in full control of development, I decided to use dotnet and Blazor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Late in 2019 I was given advanced warning that the company was being sold. In Feb 2020 the company did get sold, the new owners kept me on to finish the project I was working on but made me a permanent member of staff. In March 2020, the whole company began to work from home due to COVID-19, with parts of the business being furloughed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a difficult time; on top of the stress the whole world was feeling from the global pandemic I was trying to assist with various IT integrations that you would expect when any company gets sold.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="january-2021">January 2021&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#january-2021">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is pretty much where you find me in January 2021. I was working remotely developing internal applications with dotnet/Blazor with the occasional Teams meeting to demonstrate what I had built so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working on your own as a developer is great! You start work and can write code all day. There is no daily stand up, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain what you have been working on, or what challenges you are facing. You don&amp;rsquo;t have any process or formality to follow, only what you impose on yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a build/release pipelines in Azure DevOps, I created pull requests that would kick of a build, run my unit tests, and run some static code analysis. I would glance over my PRs but 99% of the time I would approve them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the greatest weakness of working on my own, no one to suggest ideas of better ways of writing code, no one to bounce ideas off, no one to encourage or be encouraged when I figured out something clever or offer to help you overcome a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="redundancy">Redundancy&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#redundancy">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Mid July I was told that the development function was no longer required, and my job was at risk of redundancy. As I was the only one working in development it sounded very much like a done deal. I had a couple of redundancy meetings to attend and I would need to talk through how various applications worked as part of a handover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest I agreed with the decision to make me redundant. New development work was not coming through, although the users of the applications I had developed loved what I had created, upper management were keen to migrate off these systems and use more centrally managed systems. If I was in charge, I would probably have made a similar difficult decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As soon as I found out I was at risk of redundancy I called up a couple of recruitment agents I had spoken to before. They told me that it was a great time to be looking for a job and immediately arranged some interviews for the next week. I also took advantage of social media and asked on twitter if anyone was looking for developers like me. To my surprise this resulted in at least one interview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I stressed in all my conversations with recruiters and companies I spoke with, was that I was looking for a &lt;strong>team&lt;/strong>. I wanted to work in a team, bounce ideas off others, mentor others, learn from others. This was the most important thing I wanted in whatever my next role was going to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other important things for me was continuing to use Azure or similar cloud technologies. However, I always think that the tech stack and technology can be learnt on the job, tech moves so quickly these days that you have to be constantly learning to stay relevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About two weeks after I first found out about my impending redundancy I contacted (or more likely was contacted by) a third recruitment agency. It was this third one that eventually got me a job, however all three were brilliant, and kept me updated and answered all of my questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next few days were packed with phone calls, interviews, tech tests. I had a lot of different types of companies that I spoke with, from Software Consultancy companies, FinTech companies, Energy suppliers, Legal companies and many others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this time of interviews, I can think of only two in person interviews. The rest made use of Teams, Zoom, Google Meet and even Skype (yes at least one company still uses it for video chats!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The usual way the process went was a conversation with the recruiter about a role after which my details were sent to the company, If the company liked the sound of me an initial informal interview was arranged, after that a second more technical interview was held, sometimes there would be a tech test, sometimes it was more technical questions being asked in the interview. Some companies had more stages that this, but this was what I typically encountered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I lost count of the actual number of interviews I had, but I used a spreadsheet to try and keep it all straight in my mind. The last thing I wanted was to ask a question about the wrong company!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="positive-no">Positive No&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#positive-no">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I got plenty of noes from these interviews, however all were phrased as a positive no. That being they liked me as a person but something about my skill or experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. A friend once described me as an odd mix of junior and senior developer. I agree with that statement, I have a lot of experience in some areas and a real lacking in others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common one was working in a team. Being a lone developer is not good for gaining experience working in a team. However, each time I spoke with companies I stressed that the &lt;strong>team&lt;/strong> was what I was looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another weakness of mine is front end. When I am building something, functionality is more important than getting it looking good. I came from a database and backend start, so it is only natural that I am more at home working on these things. Also, my most recent projects are working with Blazor, which is brand new and few companies are doing much with it yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried really hard not to be discouraged by these noes and that the right company was just around the corner. One no hit harder than most. I had an initial chat with the team of a FinTech Company and then there was a second interview with the CTO which I felt had gone OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From what I had heard it ticked a lot of boxes, the team sounded good, with lots of support and development opportunities and they were moving to the Cloud, so my Azure experience sounded ideal. The CTO liked me and thought I would be a good fit, but I was part way between a junior and a senior, so he had gone away to try and make a bespoke role for me, eventually it would be a no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back, it is easy to see, that this was really encouraging. They tried to create a bespoke role for me! However, at the time all I could think about was all the noes I was hearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-job-for-me">The job for me&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-job-for-me">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>About the same time, I had my initial interview with the company I would eventually accept a role with. I kept being told that there was a tech test to do, but for some reason it never got sent to me, so the interview featured a lot of tech questions and they really grilled me. I came away without much of a sense of if it went well or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, they liked me and wanted me to do a presentation at their office. I am rubbish at public speaking and doing presentations, so I thought I will do this presentation, but it is very unlikely they will like what I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The topic of my presentation was how I upskilled a team on a new project or technology. As a lone developer what an earth could I do for a topic like that? I thought about what I had done to upskill myself on various things, however that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really address the question, as they wanted to know more about what I had done to upskill a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought back to a time when I helped get a largely un-version controlled codebase into source control and automated the build and release pipeline using Azure and Azure DevOps. This involved talking to SQL and data developers so could be a better option for a presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived at the office to do my presentation. First of all, I parked next to the factory where all the forklifts were, I was directed to the correct place to park. Then I tried to go to the wrong building, a very helpful employee helped me go to the correct place. I was introduced to the people who would be interviewing me, one of whom I had worked with in the past, who immediately said you should hire this guy, he is an excellent developer! As introductions go, that&amp;rsquo;s not bad!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion the presentation was bad. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a PowerPoint or similar to go with my talk, so I just waffled on for ten minutes about what I had done a few years back about how I helped get source control being used.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-next-day-i-got-the-job-offer">The next day I got the job offer.&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-next-day-i-got-the-job-offer">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was very surprised to get the offer as I thought I had done so badly the day before they would give me another positive no. I took a few hours to think about it, however all my other applications were either not started or waiting for the next stage, so I was 99% sure I would accept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had no idea what to expect when I started, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really ask many questions at the last interview as I was convinced, I was going to get a no after my presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I worked my notice period and at the start of October I started my new job. My contract only arrived the day before I started, so in the days before I started my mind was making up reasons why the job would disappear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The job started with a two-day induction. Things that were covered on the induction were, mental health, sleep cycles, company values, health and safety and of course a bit of form filling and photocopying passports that you would expect on a first day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#conclusion">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Back when I had been job hunting, each time I stressed the importance of team. The company I had joined had an amazing focus on supporting its staff and getting the best from each other. I had got the best possible fit for the kind of team I was looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually when I start a new job, I get a large dose of imposter syndrome. Now, two months after I started, I can say, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get that this time. Maybe it is how the team functions, maybe it is my level of experience, or maybe its just something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am happy in my new job. There is a lot to learn, both technology and how to work well in this team. But I am supported, there are people to ask question, I am contributing almost from day one. I have already shared a brief talk about my experience with Blazor, which went down better than I expected. I am excited to learn what is next for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have read all the way to here, Thank you! This is my story and I hope you have found it interesting. If you are looking for a new role, I would encourage you to focus on the soft skills you are looking for next, if you concentrate on team like I did, there is a good chance you will land in an amazing team.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Deployed a new version of the Pre Qualification questionnaire website for my employers&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Passed Azure Fundamentals Exam&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Azure DevOps API -&amp;gt; built an application to show builds and releases from my Azure DevOps organisation, code is on github&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Experimented with replacing SQL Agent Jobs with Azure Functions, ended up abandoning this project but was a great learning experience&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Played with MS Graph - displaying profile pic from Azure AD but I am the only one in my org with a photo so abandoned this as well&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added a captch to a website to reduce spam&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Charted various metrics from services I use, eg twitter followers, github commits, blog posts published&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Started learning react, easily connected it with Azure AD&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Wrote my first piece of dotnet code to run on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Kept cost of Azure down, by removing unused services, refactoring and optimizing existing services.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Wow, I have done loads this year, what is next?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My road to Certification</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/my-road-to-certification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/my-road-to-certification/</guid><description>&lt;p>So today I sat the Azure Fundamentals Certification Exam and passed!
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eytphopn3inx2x77m9n5.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really pleased with myself at achieving this. It was one of my goals for 2021 so I can tick that off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back in January I booked my first exam, however due to technical problems I didn&amp;rsquo;t get as far as the Exam. In order to be able to sit an exam like this you need a webcam and microphone so you can be monitored remotely to check that you are not cheating. Something in my network was blocking them from seeing my video so it got cancelled before it started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My theory is that either my internet connection was playing up at the time, My Pi Hole was blocking something, or something else on my network was blocking the video feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cancellation put me off Certifications, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to debug the issue and find out exactly what the problem was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months back I won a free Azure Certification for taking part in a skills challenge run by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregor_suttie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Suttie&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pixel_Robots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Hooper&lt;/a>
and this was due to expire at the end of this month so I thought why not book a second exam and see if I can get past the technical problems. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any exam prep as I thought, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get that far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time I connected directly to my router, bypassing most of the network, firewall and other items on my network that could possibly cause an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cleared my desk, took photos of my ID, took pictures of my desk from every orientation, and waited for the technical issues to start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was in a queue waiting for the exam to start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A connection issue has occurred you have been sent to the back of the queue. Oh here we go again!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But no I connected with the invigilator, who asked to confirm my monitors were disconnected and to move my wallet out of reach off my desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we are off, I am answering questions from the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about the questions, but I whizzed through them, most made me think, some I guessed at. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to pass, I thought maybe half marks or just under due to my familiarity with Azure. (I have been using it for years which must count for something!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was wrong I passed comfortably and now I have my first certification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My advice for you if you have been using Azure for a while is to book this exam and see how you do, you may well pass like me. There are plenty of opportunities to get a free exam, attending conferences like Ignite often qualify you for one, look out for challenges and competitions by #AzureFamily people on twitter as they are very encouraging and helpful in your Certification journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes I am thinking about what Certificate to do next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DotNet on a Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/dotnet-on-a-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have had a Raspberry Pi for a few years and recently I connected it up again, I plugged in the camera and everything worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start off you can view photos from the camera with the raspistill command. With a bit of clever scripting and the crontab I got the Pi taking pictures every 60 seconds. Even managed to take a nice picture of a robin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e21z7vbamy6w6akhhiwd.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However scripting isn&amp;rsquo;t really programming, and I would like to write a bit more code. Dotnet can run everywhere these days and it made sense to see if it would run on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>@pete_codes has written a nice guide to getting started with dotnet on a Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/&lt;/a>
This guide and the nuget package &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unosquare.Raspberry.IO/&lt;/a>
was all I needed to get started taking pictures with my Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My initial goal is to take some wildlife pictures, stick my camera to a window and take pictures of what flies/crawls/jumps past the window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code I have written so far is available on github &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/funkysi1701/RaspberryPiDotNet&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the code takes a picture, uploads this file to Azure Blob Storage (so as not to fill up the Pi with too many image files) and deletes the image locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run a dotnet publish -c Release and then cron can run dotnet RaspberryPiDotNet.dll (with full paths to the relevant files)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use crontab to execute the code every 60 seconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My code has an appsetting.json file which has a couple of settings that need completing for my code to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storage: This is the connection string for Azure Blob Storage
LocalPath: This is the path to where the camera will save its photos to, something like /home/pi/ is all you need but feel free to specify what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the photos are in blob storage I plan to display them somewhere, add options to delete what I don&amp;rsquo;t want, maybe do something timelapsey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper release pipeline and this grates on me a bit. I have been doing a mixture of writing code in VS and pushing that to github and then doing git pull on the Pi, and also writing code directly on the Pi. (VS Code can connect via SSH which is pretty cool!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Charting my Energy usage with the Octopus Energy API</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/charting-my-energy-usage-with-the-octopus-energy-api/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2021/charting-my-energy-usage-with-the-octopus-energy-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/63ep8hp6ipyn2l4emiop.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back when I was a kid, I used to record our weekly gas and electricity meter readings in a little notebook. We then typed these reading into a spreadsheet (this was in the pre-Excel days), which allowed plotting as a line graph.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-would-i-go-about-doing-a-similar-thing-today">How would I go about doing a similar thing today?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-would-i-go-about-doing-a-similar-thing-today">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First off, I have a smart meter that submits meter readings every 30 minutes or so. However, I do not know anyway to get access to these readings directly, short of manually recording them like I did 30 years ago!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Octopus Energy have a public API which allows you to pull your consumption readings. The smart meter sends your usage to your energy supplier, in my case Octopus, they then process these readings and allow them to be queried with an API they have created. It is not a direct connection to your data, but it is the next best thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other energy suppliers will hopefully follow this example and allow users access to their consumption data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-api">How do I use the API?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-do-i-use-the-api">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Using the API is straight forward. Octopus supply you with a secret which you use to authenticate against the API with Basic Auth, no password just a username. Then you just need to pass some details of your meters to get an object containing the last few days meter readings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API Docs&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>GET /v1/electricity-meter-points/{mpan}/meters/{serial_number}/consumption/&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GET /v1/gas-meter-points/{mprn}/meters/{serial_number}/consumption/&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>{mpan}/{mprn} of your gas or electricity meter, and {serial_number} is the serial number of the meters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something to be aware of, I initially collected the last days consumption, which worked, however on one day I encountered a gap in the data for electricity. So, I changed to collect and store the last month&amp;rsquo;s data. I can then query this for what I need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually, the last 24 hours of data is available after midnight of that day. e.g. at midnight 2nd March all the data for 1st March should be available. This is not guaranteed so don&amp;rsquo;t rely on it, however I see no problem with having a few days delay between charting your usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still testing this out but so far, I have three charts for gas (and the same for electricity), the first chart covers a 24-hour period, the next covers a day total over 2 weeks, the final chart covers a total for each month (as I write this I have less than a month&amp;rsquo;s worth of data!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the day and 2 weeks charts, I plot a comparison line of the previous period so you can easily compare the current and previous usage. From my limited testing I have already discovered my usage is very similar day to day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another point of interest is that gas consumption is in m^3 and electricity is in kW/h.

One of my favourites is the option for approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two ways you can do approvals Pre and Post deployment. Lets look at both.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pre-deployment-approval">Pre Deployment Approval&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#pre-deployment-approval">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9k6vo6pfv434u7yq3mt4.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets imagine you have a simple deployment pipeline that deploys to a test/development environment before deploying to a production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre Deployment Approval happens immediately before the release so in this example, click in the ellipse before the Prod release step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will get a screen like the above, you can select what users need to approve it and how long approval waits before timing out, the default is 30 days, but I tend to use a shorter time out of 3 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="post-deployment-approval">Post Deployment Approval&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#post-deployment-approval">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/reiulrhinzqyyon6mrqi.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Post Deployment Approval happens immediately after the release so in this example, click in the circle after the Test release step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will get a screen like the above, with the same settings as before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is pretty much all there is to approvals so either option will prompt you to approve before anything gets deployed to your production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deployment-hours">Deployment Hours&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#deployment-hours">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To complicate matters I make use of the following setting to define deployment hours.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/aku2z0dl3m3xkvfvh7wd.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This setting will start the Prod deployment at 3am Mon-Fri.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I configure Post Deployment Approval, as soon as my deploy to Test has completed a request for Approval is sent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I configure Pre Deployment Approval, at 3am Mon-Fri a request for Approval is sent (not ideal if you tend to be asleep at 3am)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it looks like Post Deployment Approval is more useful for my use case. However if you deny approval either in Pre or Post approval this will mark the deployment as failed and show Red in your list of deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/vichyb1srgc1ln85hj0o.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a casual glance it looks like the deployment to Test is failing, it isn&amp;rsquo;t I am just opting to not continue my deployment to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-pipeline">My Pipeline&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#my-pipeline">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9kprp90t59owfmsmqkcp.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how I have my pipeline setup. Deployment happens on Test and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a post approval step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Test an empty stage called Approval runs and that has a post deployment approval, this happens immediately after Test so you get asked straight away for approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prod does not start as I have my deployment hours configured. Once it is time for deployment to Prod to start it executes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now a casual look at my past releases, you can easily see which have been stopped by approval and which have failed due to whatever issue, and which have run all the way through to Prod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And deployments to Prod can only ever run during my defined deployment window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am interested to hear how you have your deployment pipeline setup. Do you make use of Pre or Post Approvals? Do you ensure deployments always happen at specific times?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goals for 2021</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/goals-for-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/goals-for-2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t make any goals for 2020, or if I did, I didn&amp;rsquo;t officially announce them. 2020 has been a hard year for all of us, 2021 is going to be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few ideas for my goals for the year ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Azure certification&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mentoring&lt;/li>
&lt;li>F#&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cosmos db/Mongo db&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give a talk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mandlebrot Generator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pwned Pass Mobile App&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More time for me&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I want to get a certificate to show how much I know. The obvious area for this is Azure. I spend a lot of time playing with Azure, building and deploying to the platform I should be able to get certified in this area. I actually had an exam booked in 2020 but it was an in-person exam so was cancelled when Covid hit. I plan to sit the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foundation&lt;/a>
exam in the first quarter of 2021 and I will take it from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I have had a few times recently where I have been reminded that I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience working with others. Mostly because I work in a one-man development team so there are limited opportunities in the workplace. I have a few ideas to change this, but this is one of my top priorities for 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&amp;amp; 4) My experience is very Microsoft and C# so I want to spend some time exploring and learning tech that is adjacent to this. A functional language like F# sounds like a good compliment to my existing skills and my data skills are also very SQL server so some document database skills would be a good place to spend some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Doing a talk has been on my list for years. I am terrified of doing one and with everything online now I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that makes things easier or harder. I don&amp;rsquo;t think 2021 is going to be the year for this but maybe I will take baby steps towards this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Twitter recently reminded me about watching a Mandlebrot generate one pixel at a time in the 1980s. I would love to explore the code used to generate them and how fast they currently are to produce.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>My Google play store Xamarin forms app that uses the HIBP API has less than 100 users and I am considering closing it down, especially as I pay a monthly fee for API keys. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really decided what to do, maybe I will spend some time improving it, maybe I will close it down, maybe I will build something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For many people 2020 has been a hard year, I am one of those&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Building a Twitter Clone</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/building-a-twitter-clone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/building-a-twitter-clone/</guid><description>&lt;p>I saw a tweet about building a twitter clone being harder than you would think. So this of course started me thinking how I would go about building something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok so where would I start? First a few assumptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Development by a lone developer ie me&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tech stack will be dotnet and other tech I am familiar with&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Database backend, probably SQL Server but I might use table storage for cost reasons should I try and actually build this. However if I design this well this should be something that could be swapped out as the system grows&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User accounts on the system will be small as I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine anyone ever signing up. Why sign up to a social media platform with no users?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="i-guess-the-next-question-is-what-is-twitter">I guess the next question is what is Twitter?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#i-guess-the-next-question-is-what-is-twitter">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A website that allows you to share 280 characters of text with your followers, allows you to follow other users updates and allows other user to follow your updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also has an API that allow you to do almost everything that you can with the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there are of course mobile apps to consider but I am going to assume this is out of scope, however assuming a good enough API then this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem for future development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first-steps">First Steps&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#first-steps">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To start off with I would concentrate on the API, and then build a web client that makes use of the API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what would my MVP (minimum viable product) be?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>User can authenticate with my API to get a token which allows access to other API endpoints&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can create a tweet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can view own tweets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can view tweets of another user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can view tweets in their timeline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can follow/unfollow other users&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can search for other users&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User can search for keywords in tweets&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I think that is probably sufficient to build my MVP for the API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting side note is that I could use the OAuth Twitter authentication to allow users to login to my twitter clone with the real twitter login details. However this makes no sense to me as we are essentially adding a dependency on the real twitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what would I use for the frontend? I would start off with a Client Side Blazor frontend. Once I had a proof of concept that worked, I would think about styling and adding the UI elements that are familiar to twitter users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beauty of Client Side Blazor is that I can host cheaply in azure storage and distribute around the world via a CDN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the high number of times that follower and following count and other stats are queried I would consider storing these in the database and include a regular job to recalculate them so they don&amp;rsquo;t get out of sync with the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said all of this I am very tempted to fire up Visual Studio and see how far I get, and what problems I encounter along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#005: Twitter Cards</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/005-twitter-cards/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/005-twitter-cards/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been a bit of a mad week this week. I joined a new team so lots of time learning what&amp;rsquo;s what and also being pulled in two directions as usual demands come through on top of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My blog runs on Blazor and I have been making use of JavaScript interop to update the html headers and update the page title to match the blog post article. This works great, I load the page and check the headers and they were saying what I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem was I wanted to add tags for &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter cards&lt;/a>
This means that when I paste a link to my blog on twitter you get a nice preview and pic of me in the tweet. This was not working at all even though I had the correct headers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I eventually figured out that the problem was the fact I was using JavaScript to update my headers after the page had been initially loaded. Twitter was fetching my page before these headers got added and therefore couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the twitter card headers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My solution was to use invalid html. Not ideal but it works. I added the required html tags in the body of my page using Blazor/C# instead of using JavaScript to add them into the header. Twitter appears to not be fussy in finding them in the wrong place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twitter provides a validator tool at &lt;a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Card Validator&lt;/a>
which my website now passes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not much else to say this week, apart from I am missing Visual Studio and C#, I have been mostly using VS Code on Linux and looking at php which isn&amp;rsquo;t as much fun as my usual day job.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update #004</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/weekly-update-004/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/weekly-update-004/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use sp_send_dbmail to send results of sql queries by email to business users. Recently an issue was raised that data was being cut off after 255 characters. To fix this I added @query_no_truncate = 1, however this stopped the column headings from being included. No idea why you can&amp;rsquo;t have all the data and column headings but there you have it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I am doing now is running 2 queries, one to get the headings, and one to get the data. In theory you should be able to combine them with a Union however you then have datatype issues for non text columns so I gave up with that idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My results have 60 something columns (don&amp;rsquo;t ask its for a data import into a third party system!) so I am not typing them all out. I can shove query results into a temporary table and then execute to get a list of columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT&lt;/span> name

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However I need my list to be horizontal so I can use as column headers. I can use dynamic SQL and a pivot to flip them round.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="my-first-pr">My First PR&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#my-first-pr">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A comment was made to me to do something with the postcodes that are in the system I am developing. Find out what projects have postcodes near each other, and that way work can be grouped together and reduce potential mileage costs of staff that need to visit these projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick google search found &lt;a href="https://postcodes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://postcodes.io/&lt;/a>
which has an API that returns nearby postcodes. It also has a C# wrapper &lt;a href="https://github.com/markembling/MarkEmbling.PostcodesIO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/markembling/MarkEmbling.PostcodesIO&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A comparison of what was being returned from the wrapper and what the API said should be returned revealed that the distance between postcodes wasn&amp;rsquo;t being returned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the code was on GitHub I could easily see how easy or difficult it might be to add the missing bit of information. It was easy! So, I forked the repo and made the change. I published the change to a private NuGet repo in my Azure Dev Ops account. That way I could try my revised package to check it did what I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left a message on the GitHub project letting the owner know I had a potential fix for an issue. The project hadn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in over a year, so the owner may not be interested, or the project may have been abandoned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was in luck just 17 hours after I left a message the project owner said to create a Pull Request, which I did and shortly afterwards my code had been merged in and an updated version of the package existed in the public NuGet feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been thinking about contributing to open source for a while. However, I had not seen a project I wanted to contribute to, or a problem that I knew how to fix until now that is.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="php">PHP&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#php">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This week I had a call asking me if I knew PHP?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did, over ten years ago, before I got my first IT job, I spent time learning PHP and MySQL. I created a blog, and I also created a website for my Dad&amp;rsquo;s camera club. The code I created back then was awful. No shared code, all the code was associated with the page, or sorts of bugs occurred and as time went by it became increasingly hard to update. The site was well liked but I eventually lost interest and moved on to learn other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This call led to me talking with the head of IT, and later a couple of the developers who have since granted me access to the codebase of a project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to spend a lot of time looking at the code so far, however this is nothing like the PHP I had built before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project makes use of the &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laravel&lt;/a>
framework and the first file I opened had methods and classes, so apart from the syntax you could think you were looking at C#.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that interested me was the project used docker containers, it has automated builds as well. Lots of modern programming ideas that I had some ideas about. I am looking forward to learning more about this project and how I might contribute to it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update #002</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/weekly-update-002/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/weekly-update-002/</guid><description>&lt;p>I know Active Directory is fussy about clocks being in sync however not sure how todays issue happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I run my docker compose file from Visual Studio and I get a weird error.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>SecurityTokenNotYetValidException: IDX10222: Lifetime validation failed. The token is not yet valid. ValidFrom: &amp;#39;System.DateTime&amp;#39;, Current time: &amp;#39;System.DateTime&amp;#39;.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I deleted my containers, open and close Visual Studio a few times, nothing helps. Eventually I think to find out what the time is on my container. It has yesterday&amp;rsquo;s date. What has happened here? Surely recreating containers would have caused them to have todays date? I reboot and everything is fine again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out that it is a know issue, see &lt;a href="https://thorsten-hans.com/docker-on-windows-fix-time-synchronization-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://thorsten-hans.com/docker-on-windows-fix-time-synchronization-issue&lt;/a>
I am using WSL2 and I have now changed back to using Hyper-V and the issue hasn&amp;rsquo;t come back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier in the week I spotted my build step was failing.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#f92672">task&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">NuGetToolInstaller@0&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Swapping to the next version of the step is all I needed to do to fix it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A week off work, mainly to use it up before year end, plus want to get a few jobs around the house done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did ask the following question on Twitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/azurefamily?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#azurefamily&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dotnet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#dotnet&lt;/a> developers how do I get more involved in mentoring?&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Simon Foster (@funkysi1701) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/funkysi1701/status/1325742644014829568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2020&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>

to listen to. Due to time zones and family commitments, I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to an awful lot of it but I did see the keynote and loved the 3 Scott&amp;rsquo;s chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#wednesday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My youngest son was 3 today, due to Coronavirus we didn&amp;rsquo;t do much but we celebrated as a family, and he even had a zoom call.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thursday">Thursday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#thursday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Blazor has a new feature &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/virtualization?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtualize&lt;/a>
where a list of items can only load the ones on screen. I have been trying to get this to work on my blog, works great running locally but not working in production yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think I know what might be happening. I use Cloudflare to do my SSL, as Custom SSL certs for the cheaper Azure Web Apps is not supported. Something in Cloudflare is caching or interfering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://zimmergren.net/solved-asp-net-core-blazor-web-sites-does-not-work-with-cloudflare-html-minification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://zimmergren.net/solved-asp-net-core-blazor-web-sites-does-not-work-with-cloudflare-html-minification/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turning off HTML minification fixed my issue!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One additional thing I added to my Blog is the &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/config">/config&lt;/a>
page which details some of the config settings. I think this probably came from &lt;a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/adding-a-git-commit-hash-and-azure-devops-build-number-and-build-id-to-an-aspnet-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.hanselman.com/blog/adding-a-git-commit-hash-and-azure-devops-build-number-and-build-id-to-an-aspnet-website&lt;/a>
but it was a while ago when I first did this on another project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment we have .net Version, Commit and Build links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The .Net Version is obtained from&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>@System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.FrameworkDescription
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>A few other bits of info can be obtained from System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation which I have included on the page for fun. There are probably security concerns with exposing all this info publicly so something to bear in mind if you try this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Build Info is passed to my code by a build step&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- &lt;span style="color:#f92672">script&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;(echo $(Build.BuildNumber) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo $(Build.BuildId)) &amp;gt; .buildinfo.json&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">displayName&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Emit build number&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">workingDirectory&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/src/WebBlog&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">failOnStderr&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This simply passed the build id and number which are stored as variabled and saves them in a text file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then have a class that reads them and constructs a link.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Head on over to &lt;a href="https://securityheaders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://securityheaders.com/&lt;/a>
This is a site created by security expert &lt;a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Helme&lt;/a>
that rates a URL based on what response headers it can see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am pleased to say &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com">www.funkysi1701.com&lt;/a>
is now getting an A.&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/07rwumi94fz141hwessu.PNG" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how do you add/remove headers in dotnet core?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my configure method in Startup.cs I have the following code block.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>app.Use(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> next =&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> context =&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> context.Response.OnStarting(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> () =&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> context.Response.Headers.Add(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Permissions-Policy&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;microphone=()&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> context.Response.Headers.Remove(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Server&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> context.Response.Headers.Remove(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;X-Powered-By&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> context.Response.Headers.Remove(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;X-AspNet-Version&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Task.CompletedTask;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> });
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> next(context);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> });
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have only included a few of the headers I am adding as the excellent &lt;a href="https://securityheaders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://securityheaders.com/&lt;/a>
can tell you which headers you should add and what options you might want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Back to Blogging</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/back-to-blogging/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/back-to-blogging/</guid><description>&lt;p>My last blog post was over six months ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Covid 19 has hit the world, and I will be honest I have found it a challenging time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Blog had gotten into a bit of a mess. It had become fragmented with different versions of the same thing; I will attempt to explain what has become of my blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original WordPress site can currently be found at &lt;a href="https://www.pwnedpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.pwnedpass.com/&lt;/a>
I would prefer it to be on a sub-domain of funkysi1701.com but for some reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get that to work, not sure if it is a limitation of my hosting package. I like WordPress, it is very flexible, easy to get blog posts out there. But I want to write content about development and having a site I can tinker with is important to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of my WordPress blogs have been imported into dev.to and a few extra have been written on this platform. I like dev.to it is a wonderful place to share content and it has one or two extra features I like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>dev.to has an integration with Stackbit/Netlify and this became &lt;a href="https://dev.funkysi1701.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dev.funkysi1701.com&lt;/a>
. I like having a personal site, but having the same content as dev.to. To add content to this site all I need to do is write it on dev.to and some magic will go on behind the scenes and new content will be published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as a developer I don&amp;rsquo;t like magic, I want to understand what is going on a fiddle with all the settings and make it do what I want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>dev.to has an API, I can build a site in .Net Core and make API calls to fetch the content I want. I understand APIs, I understand .Net and can customise my site exactly how I want it, plus play about with a .net website. This is what &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com">https://www.funkysi1701.com&lt;/a>
is now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what have I built so far. I have a Server Side Blazor site running .Net 5. Why Server Side and not Client Side I hear you ask? Well only because I have more experience with Server Side and know how to quickly create a website with that technology, I may change it as time goes by, but we will see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have two pages a list of my blog posts and a page that displays the content. Both of these use the dev.to API. I lied, there is a third page I hacked together to do some page redirection from the WordPress URLs. This is something I will change as time goes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of improvements I want to do, there are probably also lots of broken images or links as well. Hopefully, this will result in a good platform to blog about as well as on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing for expiring SSL Certificates</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/testing-for-expiring-ssl-certificates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2020/testing-for-expiring-ssl-certificates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is amazing, you can easily add SSL certificates to any website and automate the renewal process. I have talked &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/let-s-encrypt-is-awesome-3f5j/">before&lt;/a>
about how impressive it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you start adding SSL certificates to your production sites however you may want to check when they expire so you don&amp;rsquo;t get caught out. You can always open your site in your favourite browser and view the certificate information and expiry date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="SSL Cert" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jb78re4fmm1ofx81f3mu.JPG" loading="lazy"
/>
However there is a way to automate this check.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[Fact]&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> handler = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> HttpClientHandler
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = CustomCallback
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> HttpClient(handler);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.example.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Assert.True(response.IsSuccessStatusCode);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">bool&lt;/span> CustomCallback(HttpRequestMessage arg1, X509Certificate2 arg2, X509Chain arg3, SslPolicyErrors arg4)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> now = DateTime.UtcNow;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> expire = arg2.NotAfter;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> diff = (expire - now).TotalDays;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Assert.InRange(diff, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">30&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1000&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> arg4 == SslPolicyErrors.None;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This code gets the SSL expiry date from &lt;a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.example.com&lt;/a>
and will fail the xunit test if the expiry date is less than 30 days in the future. I then schedule my tests to run regularly on all my environments with a Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Certificate and this gives me advanced warning if a SSL certificate is about to expire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Assert.InRange(diff, 30, 1000) line will fail the test if the expiry date is less than 30 days or greater than 1000, but as the default expiry for Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt certificates is three months it will never be greater than 1000 days even with a freshly installed certificate. These values can be tweaked to suit your use case, however 30 days is enough time for me to investigate what is happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To execute my tests I use a scheduled build in Azure DevOps, but anything that regularly can run your tests will do the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code above is just a simple example to get your started for my purposes I have put all my URLs into config files and just pass these into my tests, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need a custom test for every different URL.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Picard is back!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/picard-is-back/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/picard-is-back/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has just been announced at the annual Star Trek Las Vegas (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/STLV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#STLV&lt;/a>
) convention that Patrick Stewart is going to return to his role as Jean-Luc Picard in a new TV Show.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe type="text/html" width="662" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCKQp1sGVRQ?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>Few other details have been announced other than the TV show will take place 20 years after the film Star Trek: Nemesis and will feature the character of Jean-Luc Picard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets run though a few things I would like to see from this new show.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="low-on-action">Low on Action&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#low-on-action">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Star Trek: Discovery is a great show and has brought Star Trek back to our TV shows. However it is an action show, it zooms along so fast and with so much action I would appreciate a show that can takes its time a bit more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want a show that can show Picard carefully considering some moral issue and making a decision. Something we were used to seeing on TNG.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="feature-picards-excellent-speeches">Feature Picard’s excellent speeches&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#feature-picards-excellent-speeches">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the best features I can think of Jean-Luc Picard is his ability to make speeches about one issue or other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Insurection&lt;/strong> : Picard speaks about the forced relocation of a group of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How many people does it take, Admiral, before it becomes wrong? Hmm? A thousand, fifty thousand, a million? How many people does it take, Admiral?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>First&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Contact&lt;/strong> : Picard is hell bent on revenge for what the Borg have done to him and refuses to destroy the Enterprise to save his crew.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I will not sacrifice the Enterprise. We’ve made too many compromises already. Too many retreats. They invade our space and we fall back. They assimilate entire worlds, and we fall back. Not again! The line must be drawn here, …this far, no further! And I will make them pay for what they’ve done.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Measure of a Man&lt;/strong> : Picard argues for the rights of Data.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You see, he’s met two of your three criteria for sentience, so what if he meets the third. Consciousness in even the smallest degree. What is he then? I don’t know. Do you? (to Riker) Do you? (to Phillipa) Do you? Well, that’s the question you have to answer. Your Honour, the courtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product, the truth for all time. Now, sooner or later, this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regard this creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people we are, what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroom and this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagely curtailing them for others. Are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after him to servitude and slavery? Your Honour, Starfleet was founded to seek out new life. Well, there it sits. Waiting. You wanted a chance to make law. Well, here it is. Make a good one.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="ask-important-questions">Ask important questions&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#ask-important-questions">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We live in uncertain times. There are lots of pressures on today’s world and we need to acknowledge these. Picard is an excellent character to use to ask important questions of the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it mean to be human?&lt;br>
How should we treat people that are different to us?&lt;br>
How should we react to extremism?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deal-with-his-age">Deal with his age&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#deal-with-his-age">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the last episode of TNG a future version of Picard is shown 25 years into the future. This is a similar time period so it will be interesting to compare the two. Have Picard look back on his life and ask questions about his life choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Picard" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/all-good-things.jpg?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="be-consistent-with-his-past">Be consistent with his past&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#be-consistent-with-his-past">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Picard is a well known character. So writers please don’t change him. I want a character we know, not a character that looks like Picard but acts in a way contrary to what we would expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Picard has a history we know, he served on the stargazer and of course the Enterprise, he has an artificial heart, he was assimiliated by the Borg. All&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reference-50-years-of-star-trek">Reference 50 years of Star Trek&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#reference-50-years-of-star-trek">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discovery and Enterprise are TV shows which have a problem. There is Trek going on after them which imposes a few rules on what can and can’t be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a TV Show that will take place after every other Trek TV and Film and can do whatever the creators want. This gives freedom, but it also gives the responsibility to reference what has gone before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Picard" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/download.jpg?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2009 Star Trek film features the destruction of Romulus and Spock travelling back in time. How about Picard dealing with surviving Romulans helping rebuild their society, continuing the work that Spock started in the TNG episode Unification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I look forward to finding out what the Star Trek production team has in store for us. If they have Patrick Stewart convinced I am sure it is going to be good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gated Release</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/gated-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/gated-release/</guid><description>&lt;p>Automated releases of software are great but how can we add an element of feedback so only good releases go live.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been using Azure DevOps to release my &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/pwned-pass/">PwnedPass&lt;/a>
android app to the Google Play Store for a while now. There are options to deploy to the alpha, Beta or Production tracks and even to set % of users to target. For the full range of options check out the Google Play &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension&lt;/a>
for Azure DevOps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My release starts by publishing to 10% of users on the production track, my next step makes use of the increase rollout option to increase this %, you can have as many of these additional steps as you want until you reach 100% of your users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image.png?fit=662%2C116&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you run this release now it will just run through each of the steps one after the other. Now of course you can add a pre or post approval to your pipeline but this just adds a manual dependency to your release. Whoever does the approving needs to check things are working before approving or worse just approves regardless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure DevOps has the concept of &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/deploy-using-approvals?view=azure-devops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gated releases&lt;/a>
which allows you to add automated checks before or after a release happens. These automated checks can be any of the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An Azure Function&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Rest API call&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Azure Monitor Alert&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Query Work Items&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security and Compliance Assessment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are going to make use of the Azure Monitor Alert, to create an alert from your Application Insights data and only continue the rollout if no failures are detected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open up your application insights resource in the Azure portal and look in alerts. Click add new alert rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-1.png?fit=662%2C552&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select your application insights resource in Resource, In Condition choose a condition to check, I chose Failed Requests, so every time a failure is registered in my API I can stop the deployment. The exact criteria you want to use is entirely up to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create an action group, I just set my alert to send an email to myself but there are other alert actions you may want to try. Give your alert a name and description and click save.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all we need to do is make Azure DevOps make use of this alert. In your release pipeline select the pre-deployment conditions of your second step and open up the Gates section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-2.png?fit=662%2C498&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a suitable time to evaluate, I have been using something long like 12 or 24 hours so if there are problems there is time for it to be noticed. Choose Version 1 of the task (I was not able to get it to work with Version 0)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now select your Azure subscription and Resource Group and leave the rest of the settings as they are. Now your Deployment will stop and analyse application insights for any Failed requests and will halt if it finds any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-3.png?fit=662%2C88&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still testing this out but it will take a few days to figure out if this what I want due to the large time scales involved. I feel this is going to be an improvement of manually approving release steps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Documenting your API</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/documenting-your-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/documenting-your-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>So you have created a super API that does something amazing.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>});
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">//In Configure&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>app.UseSwagger();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> c.SwaggerEndpoint(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;/swagger/v1/swagger.json&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;API V1&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> c.RoutePrefix = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>.Empty;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>});
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now when you browse to your API you will see the swagger documentation system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-3.png?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RoutePrefix setting controls the path in which swagger will display. I have my docs at the root, but you might want them under the /docs or similar path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IncludeXmlComments setting from the ConfigureServices method allows you to load in any XML comments you have added to methods. For this to work you need to enable a setting to your build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4.png?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The XML documentation file must be ticked and contain a path. Everytime you do a build, a XML file will be generated which contains all the comment blocks you have added to your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-5.png?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Swagger will then use this XML documentation file to produce lovely looking documentation without you having to do anything extra.&lt;/p>

is a secure way of storing your keys, certificates and secrets so your application can access everything it needs to but you don’t have them being stored insecurely anywhere such as in source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been wanting to give Azure Key Vault a try for a while now as it can make use of Azure Active Directory to give your web app an identity so it can authenticate itself into the key vault to access secrets. Pretty clever but with a lot of moving parts a bit complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For my example I am just going to connect to my Key Vault and get a secret and display it somewhere on a web page. This is of course not what you want to do as secrets are secret and shouldn’t be displayed just used to authenticate into whatever, however it is an easy way to prove I am connecting to the Key Vault and everything is working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at some code. I have a .net core application and to start with lets install three nuget packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault
Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I’ve not include version numbers as these will no doubt get updated over time but hopefully it will still work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now in your Program.cs add the following code, replacing [KeyVaultName] with the name of your Key Vault.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Program&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> Main(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>[] args)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>[] args) =&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) =&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> builtConfig = config.Build();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> azureServiceTokenProvider = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AzureServiceTokenProvider();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> keyVaultClient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> KeyVaultClient(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> KeyVaultClient.AuthenticationCallback(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> azureServiceTokenProvider.KeyVaultTokenCallback));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> config.AddAzureKeyVault(
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">$&amp;#34;https://[KeyVaultName].vault.azure.net/&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> keyVaultClient,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> DefaultKeyVaultSecretManager());
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> })
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> .UseApplicationInsights()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> .UseStartup&amp;lt;Startup&amp;gt;();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now all you need to do is look at your configuration to pull out secrets from your Azure Key Vault. If you have a secret called AppSecret then you can use the following code snippet to retrieve its value, assuming _configuration is an implementation of Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>_configuration[&amp;#34;AppSecret&amp;#34;];
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Now if you do all of this and run from an Azure Web App or run locally it will fail to pull anything from the Key Vault. You need to give your web app an identity and configure your key vault to allow access from that identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once my code has been deployed to an Azure Web App I get the following error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image.png?fit=662%2C292&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at fixing that, first lets give my web app an Identity. Open up the Azure portal and find the identity section of your web app and turn the setting on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-1.png?fit=662%2C396&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you need to grant that identity permission to your key vault. In the portal open up Access Policies in your key vault and click add Policy, select the identity of your web app in the principal box and select the following settings to grant access to your secret.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-2.png?resize=206%2C428&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you have a website that can pull secrets out of Key Vault but only that unique identity. Anyone who has access to your source code will not have access to your secrets, even if they push your code to a different Azure Web App.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Technology I want to learn more about</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/technology-i-want-to-learn-more-about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/technology-i-want-to-learn-more-about/</guid><description>&lt;p>While at &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2019/02/26/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-london">Microsoft Ignite&lt;/a>
I heard about a lot of cool tech that I want to know more about. The best way to learn something is use it to solve a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what can I build that is both useful and will let me play with some new tech?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a Xamarin Forms app &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/pwned-pass/">Pwned Pass&lt;/a>
that has over 500 downloads on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google play&lt;/a>
and over 80 downloads on the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/pwned-pass/9nm2whnztnlt?rtc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store&lt;/a>
. This has given me a small user base that I can use to make use of whatever I build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My app makes use of the &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIBP API&lt;/a>
created by Troy Hunt. I am going to build my own API, initially it will just make calls to the HIBP API. Building this will give me experience of building something with .net Core from design to deployment. I have made a start already on doing this, I have an empty .net core API project which deploys to an Azure web app using the build and release pipelines from Azure DevOps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may be wondering why I am not making use of Azure Functions to build this API. Azure functions is certainly a great technology that is worth learning about. However I have done a little bit with them in the past and I don’t believe I would be able to learn all the things I want to if I used Azure Functions. My primary goal is learning and sharing that learning via this blog. It may well be I move to using Azure Functions later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another tech I am keen to learn more about is &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/key-vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Key Vault&lt;/a>
. This is a technology that allows the securing of keys, connection strings and certificates. I want my app to securely get keys and security information without any of it having to be committed to source code or shared insecurely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monitoring my app is also a key learning from me. I use application insights already, but I would like to extend my understanding of this so telemetry can be fed back into the build and bad deployments stopped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is my complete list of learning and tech I want to touch on. It is a long list and I imagine it will get longer as I work through it. I want to regularly blog and share what I have been working on. I currently have a working build and release pipeline but nothing of note to build or release. I know Key Vault needs looking at early as the identity of the website in Azure is key to getting that tech working correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Build API with .net core&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add build and release pipeline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make use of Azure KeyVault for secrets, connection strings etc&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plugin My Xamarin app to make use of it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor my API with Application Insights&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secure it with CSPs and log this into &lt;a href="https://report-uri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report URI&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consider building a web frontend to my API using a javascript library or framework. Maybe react but this can be decided later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dockerize the API and add the creation of docker images to the build/release pipeline&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Microsoft Ignite | The Tour – London</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-london/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/microsoft-ignite-the-tour-london/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have just spent the first day at the conference Microsoft Ignite | The Tour.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/D0UTj08XgAEo1YJ.jpg?fit=662%2C440&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
The conference was free I just needed to arrange travel and accommodation. Microsoft have really looked after me and all the other guests, breakfast and lunch has been provided, I got a free t-shirt, coffee (or tea) all day plus a beer or glass of wine to end the day. And that’s before you collect any free stuff the vendors are giving away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first session was Designing resilient cloud applications with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeMillMatt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Soucoup&lt;/a>
and talked about some cloud technologies like Azure key vault and serving static files from blob storage. Unfortunately this had a few technical issues with the demos. I think it was just connectivity with the MongoDB backend but this slightly spoiled the session. As this was the only technical problem I noticed all day I can let it pass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next was a session on Azure DevOps mainly build and release pipelines called Deploying your application faster and safer with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bbenz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Benz&lt;/a>
. A lot of this I knew but good to reinforce I am doing things correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next was a session on Application Insights called Detecting application anomalies with Telemetry with Matt Soucoup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably the most useful session was on Docker and Kubernetes called Integrate containers and Kubernetes into your Azure DevOps build and release model with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/crad77" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco De Sanctis&lt;/a>
. Going to spend some time looking through the examples from this session.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A session on Serverless covered Azure Functions, Azure Logic apps and the other Azure Serverless offerings. Investing in Serverless: less servers, more code with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simona_cotin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simona Cotin&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly was a panel discussion on the changes facing IT Pros and SysAdmins. What is the future of the IT Pro in a DevOps &amp;amp; Cloudy world? with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jenstirrup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Stirrup&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bakionur" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baki Onur Okutucu&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmyKateNicho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Boyd&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheOpsMgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Thair&lt;/a>
. Should they learn to code, how should they make sure they keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow I have a loads more sessions, including ones about mental health, Azure pipelines, more Kubernetes stuff and dealing with failure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yaml Builds on Azure DevOps</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/yaml-builds-on-azure-devops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/yaml-builds-on-azure-devops/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been using Azure DevOps (Or VSTS or VSO etc) for a while now and one of the great features is doing automatic builds with every check-in. This is more commonly known as a CI (continuous integration) build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More recently I have started playing about with creating my build using YAML files instead of using the web user interface to create my build.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#why">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You may wonder why go to the effort of learning the YAML syntax when you can just create the build in Azure DevOps and then forget about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly it is because the build changes over time and you shouldn’t just forget about it. If something changes over time then you might want to version control it, or look at a previous version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets say you create a pull request that replaces a .net 4.7 web service with a .net core web service. If you have a CI build this PR will fail because it won’t build. If you change the build first any other builds going on will fail. What you want in this case is the build to be associated with that branch or PR. Any builds before you merge this change in will continue to work and any after this change will also work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How do you get started with YAML builds? Well the first thing is to make sure that YAML builds are turned on, as I write this I believe they are still a feature you can turn on or off. Have a look in Preview features and make sure they are turned on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next look at any of your existing builds and click the View YAML link. This will show you an example YAML file of your existing build. You could just save this as azure-pipelines.yml and checkin to the root of your project. You can also click the add new build pipeline option, this will give you some templates to start you off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The YAML file consists of a series of build steps usually called tasks, with a few settings before to configure things like parameters or build agents. Detailed docs about the syntax of the file can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&amp;amp;tabs=schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For my mobile app my YAML files consist of downloading nuget packages, building the solution, building specific projects with desired settings, running powershell or other scripts to set things up and finally publishing the results of the build as artifacts so that they can be used in any releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="secure-it">Secure It!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#secure-it">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Avoid committing passwords and secure keys into source control. I have found you can upload secure files via Azure DevOps and then add a download secure files step at the start of your build. This allows the secure file to be used during the build but the contents of the file can’t be viewed by anyone with access to the source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find it often takes a bit of thinking about how to achieve this, but it is usually possible to keep keys and secrets secure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pwned Pass Update</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/pwned-pass-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/pwned-pass-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Its been a while since I first released Pwned Pass so lets have a look at where we are now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are very close to 500 Downloads from &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play&lt;/a>
and we have recently smashed past 100 active installs, peaking at 116 and even now we are still over 100. I have had 9 reviews (6 x 5*, 2 x 1 * and a 4 *) which averages out at 4 *
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image.png?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
Over Christmas I released a UWP version that can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NM2WHNZTNLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store&lt;/a>
. This has currently had 9 downloads and even had a download to windows mobile (someone out there still likes the platform!)
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-1.png?w=662&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
I have a fairly smooth deployment process using Azure DevOps. After every check in of code a build runs which compiles the UWP and Android versions. The build also increments the version numbers that is required to deploy to either of the app stores.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every successful build of the master branch will kick off a release to the Beta track of Google Play. If I am happy I then release to 10% of the Production track, which can then be increased to 100% (or halted). The release to Microsoft Store happens after the Beta track of Google Play. Only reason for this order is that there isn’t a beta area for UWP apps so I want to quickly test change on android before rolling out for windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these steps require confirmation by me before proceeding and often don’t get further than the beta track.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A further development is that I have open sourced the source code to &lt;a href="">github&lt;/a>
do take a look if you are curious or want to contribute. With the purchase by Microsoft there are easy ways to connect github repositories to Azure DevOps. Once I create a Pull Request in github it creates a build in Azure DevOps and all the build and release steps can happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still not 100% sure if I want to keep my bug and issue tracking in github or Azure DevOps as both have features for doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One future improvement I want to make is to automate the creation of screenshots. When I create a new feature and it gets checked in. I would like to automatically created screenshots of the key pages and submit them to the different app stores. Currently I am not sure if this is possible or how to go about it. I have some ideas to experiment with so we will see what I can do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lets see what 2019 can do!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/lets-see-what-2019-can-do/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2019/lets-see-what-2019-can-do/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my annual lets make some goals for the new year blog post.

&lt;p>I can’t outdo last years goal of buying a house but I can continue to make efforts to improve it. I was going to put something about decorating or doing something to our bedrooms, however today I spotted a hole in the roof so this may well absorb most of my home improvement budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="connect-with-local-area">Connect with local area&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#connect-with-local-area">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since we moved in October we haven’t really connected with our local area yet. My only interaction with my neighbours was when my car blocked his drive!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to make efforts to change this in 2019. I don’t exactly know how yet, but I have some ideas. My son starts nursery and later school this year so could be one way to meet other parents and teachers. I want to connect with a local church, so far this hasn’t happened so need to make more effort with this. There are other local groups that put on child friendly events which would be good to attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I failed last year to do this so it is back on my list. I know I must have stuff of value to share so going to try again on this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lightning talk is a very short talk or presentation given at a conference or user group. I am not a natural public speaker so this is a step out of my comfort zone, however I am going to start small and see what happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>##Family Holiday
As always we Fosters are going to have a holiday in the summer and have some quality family time. I also want to take the boys to London for a weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="blogging">Blogging&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#blogging">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This blog has taken a bit of a backseat in 2018 so I want to try and refocus it for 2019. My commitment is for 12 blog posts in 2019, that is one a month. It doesn’t sound like much but I know how easily life can get in the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said that my log has had record views this year. 7159 views. However I believe this number to be incorrect and has been inflated by my app development and some of the automated processes taking place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="routine">Routine&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#routine">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last goal is to try a get more of a routine going. With two small boys, one of which is starting school in September a routine is going to be essential and will allow all of us all a chance to get more things done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back at 2018</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/looking-back-at-2018/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/looking-back-at-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p>As 2018 starts to draw to a close let’s look at some of the highlights from the past year.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>New Home - I started 2018 with the goal of buying my own home and I managed it. At the end of October I actually moved in but it was months of looking at houses, speaking to estate agents, saving, packing and unpacking. There is more I want to do to my home in 2019 so this is only really the beginning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New Job - Another goal was to kick my career up a notch and this happened in June. It has been great working as part of a large team and I have learnt loads, there is much more I want to learn and contribute to so 2019 should be great on that front.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New Car - Not a goal that I achieved as unfortunately in October I was involved in a car accident, no one was seriously hurt but this was a horrible experience to go through. My car was written off which gave me an excuse to buy a new car.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>See more of family was a goal, I am not sure if I really achieved this. However family have been around loads for us during our move and we do live closer so hopefully I can work on this some more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Celebrate 5 years of marriage. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been an easy year for me and the wife due to moving house and all the stress that involved plus with two children she was diagnosed with Postnatal Depression which as a family we are still dealing with. All that said we had a fab weekend away and we so need to do something similar again soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family. 2018 has included many great times with my two boys. It&amp;rsquo;s been amazing seeing them grow, in September we had a thanksgiving service for them and in July we had our annual holiday.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lightning Talk. This is the only thing I mentioned as a goal that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen, it&amp;rsquo;s on my 2019 list so hopefully I can kick myself into action but with everything else I achieved something had to slip.   &lt;/li>

&lt;p>My development environment has typically required installing SQL Server. SQL is a bit of a beast with lots of options and takes time to setup how you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However since Microsoft have now created a version of SQL Server that runs on Linux you can run SQL Server in a Linux container with only a few commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to assume you already have Docker for windows installed on your development machine. If not head over to &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#where-to-go-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker&lt;/a>
and find out how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Microsoft guide to setting up SQL Server in a Linux container can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need to download the image. In a powershell window run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This downloads the latest sql server image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To run this image run the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1433:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run a SQL Server image you are required to accept the terms and conditions and set a default sa password. These are added as environment variables with the -e flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also need to set the ports that your container will run on (1433 is the default SQL port) and give your container a name, in this case &amp;ldquo;sql&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have already installed SQL Server you will not be able to run the container on the same port as your local install. To solve this you can select a different port.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -e &amp;#34;ACCEPT_EULA=Y&amp;#34; -e &amp;#34;SA_PASSWORD=password&amp;#34;
-p 1434:1433 --name sql
-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>-p 1434:1433 maps the 1433 port on the container to port 1434 of your local environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have run this command you can connect SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to (local) or (local),1434 if you are using a different port using the credentials you provided and execute any SQL you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your development environment requires windows authentication this of course is not for you, if it doesn’t you are good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The development environment I have been using has various powershell scripts for setting things up. These assume windows auth. However I have adapted them to take custom credentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$credential = Get-Credential $server.ConnectionContext.LoginSecure=$false
$server.ConnectionContext.set_Login($credential.UserName)
$server.ConnectionContext.set_SecurePassword($credential.Password)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The Get-Credential command creates a dialog where you can enter SQL credentials, this is then stored in a variable and used in the rest of the script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do I restore a backup file to my container?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker exec -it sql mkdir /var/opt/mssql/backup
docker cp database.bak sql:/var/opt/mssql/backup
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This creates a backup folder and copies a backup file from your local environment to the container. You can then use management studio to restore the backup file (or you could write a sql script to do it). One thing to note when restoring databases, make sure the files are restored to Linux locations not windows locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only issues I have encountered so far are the lack of support for SSIS packages and no windows auth. There are sql server windows images available which I haven’t tried yet which may work better with some of these options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2018 The Story So far</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/2018-the-story-so-far/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/2018-the-story-so-far/</guid><description>&lt;p>Remember me? I used to write blog posts but somehow life got in the way. So much has happened this year, lets have a look at my &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2018/lets-see-what-2018-can-do">goals&lt;/a>
for 2018 and see how far we have got with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buy-a-house">Buy a house&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#buy-a-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My first goal for 2018 was to buy a house. Well so much progress has been made with this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We looked at a few houses, and have made an offer, had it accepted and are waiting for the last few things to get arranged before we start arranging to move in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The location we decided upon was &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Thorne,&amp;#43;Doncaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thorne&lt;/a>
. This is about an hour from York where most of our friends are and my wife has lived all her life, and also an hour from where my family live. I have tried my best to balance location and size of property and we think our new home is going to be a good balance but only time will tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a bit of a mammoth time ahead of me getting everything we own packed up and moved to our new home so wish me luck, but we will get there it is just going to be hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-job">New Job&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#new-job">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In June 2018 I started a new job. This was slightly later than I had hoped but I believe it has been worth the wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new job has lots of perks. Finish early on a Friday (1pm), On site canteen, Cool air-conditioned office, Flexible working hours, Part of a big development team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main benefit is that I am part of a big development team. I have a huge list of things to learn both in terms of technology and how large development teams function. The team is about to finish the first sprint that I have contributed to. My contributions have been very small. A bug fix here, a tweak of an API there. But the important thing is that I am making a contribution and learning along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have also started asking questions about deployment and how this could be automated. Something that interests me, especially with the sysadmin and devops background. I have been tasked with learning &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker&lt;/a>
, so expect some blog posts on this topic in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="see-more-of-family">See more of family&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#see-more-of-family">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This one I am going to count as a miss. I have seen family a few times this year, but my efforts have been more on the first two items in this list. Hopefully this will change as things settle down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">Celebrate 5 years of Marriage&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Me and the wife had a great weekend away to celebrate our wedding anniversary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-my-two-children">Celebrate my two children&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-my-two-children">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not happened yet but it is booked and we just need to arrange a few more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have made no effort to do a talk and this is going to be a goal for 2019 I think. Most of the reason is concentrating on the other areas above, but also because I am not a natural speaker and I don’t like stepping out of my comfort zone. But I will do it, I just need to wait for other things to calm down a bit first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="family-holiday">Family Holiday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#family-holiday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We had a great week away at the start of July. The weather was really great (and still is) and we had lots of time doing things as a family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Casting and Converting between types</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/casting-and-converting-between-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/casting-and-converting-between-types/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I was asked how to convert a number to a string. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few ways of approaching this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most objects in c# have a method called ToString() which displays the string representation of that object. This is because of inheritance, all objects inherit from System.Object which defines ToString().&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Int32 is a struct so it inherits from System.ValueType which also inherits from System.Object&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so in code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> a = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">9&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> b = a.ToString();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the reverse. However the reverse runs the risk of throwing an error, let&amp;rsquo;s look at why.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> b = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;9&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> c = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> d = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;two&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>All are valid strings but only one can be converted to a number. Use the TryParse method to convert to a number.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span>.TryParse(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;9&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">out&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> e);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>TryParse will not throw an exception if the conversion fails, if it succeeds variable e will contain the result. Note an earlier version of c# required you to define the out parameter before using it with TryParse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>int.Parse exists to do the same thing however it will throw exceptions if a conversion is not possible. The same is true if you use Convert.ToInt32(&amp;ldquo;two&amp;rdquo;);&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="casting">Casting&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#casting">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Casting is a way to explicitly telling the compiler that a type is actually another type and you are aware data loss will occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">double&lt;/span> x = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4.5&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> y = (&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span>)x;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However it is not possible to cast a string to a number format as a string can contain any character not just number characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Let’s Encrypt is awesome</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-encrypt-is-awesome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-encrypt-is-awesome/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s Encrypt is a free way to get a SSL certificate onto your website and until recently I had never tried it. It is very easy and I think it is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IIS is the web server software the Microsoft include with Windows 10 and Windows Server. I have it installed on my laptop and it displays the default IIS page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iis.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not really a good idea to host websites on your laptop, use a dedicated web server, or host with a hosting company, however the techniques are the same and it gives me something to write about!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to point a domain name at what IIS on my machine was serving up I did the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do a google search for “whats my IP”, this will return your public IP. Most residential ISPs use dynamic IPs so it may change over time, (which is another reason not to host a website on your laptop!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add an A record on a domain with the IP address you have just got&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your public IP most likely points at your router not your laptop so enable port forwarding of port 80 and port 443 to the internal IP of your laptop (something like 192.168.0.11 etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now comes the fun Let’s Encrypt stuff!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need a Let’s Encrypt client, there are a lot of them out there mostly for linux flavours, however a bit of googling found a windows one. Go to &lt;a href="https://github.com/PKISharp/win-acme/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/PKISharp/win-acme/releases&lt;/a>
and download the zip file and unzip it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run the executable from the zip file and follow the onscreen prompts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/letsencrypt.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Press N to create a new certificate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then press 1 to bind to single website found in your IIS setup&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/letsencrypt2.jpg?resize=768%2C686&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now magically Let’s Encrypt knows what you have setup in IIS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all you need to do is enter an email address incase a renewal fails and agree to the let’s encrypt terms and you are all setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/letsencrypt3.jpg?resize=768%2C920&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How awesome and easy is that for getting your websites working with a SSL certificate. If you have IIS configured on a server, give it a try and you can SSL all your things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DNS for Developers</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/dns-for-developers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/dns-for-developers/</guid><description>&lt;p>DNS is the backbone of the internet and as such I believe every developer should know something about the basics and not just leave it for the sysadmin to sort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-dns">What is DNS?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-is-dns">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>DNS or Domain Name System is what translates Domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wait-what-is-an-ip-address-and-what-are-domain-names">Wait what is an IP address and what are domain names?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#wait-what-is-an-ip-address-and-what-are-domain-names">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You do realise this is a developer blog? An IP address is a unique address on the internet and a domain name is a user friendly label for one or more of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example might be google.com which for me resolves to 216.58.204.14&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-it-works">How it works&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-it-works">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dns-rev-1.gif?resize=360%2C320&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
When your browser makes a request to google.com it makes a request to your ISPs DNS Servers. This resolves google.com to 216.58.204.14&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In more detail your ISPs DNS server will forward the DNS query to another DNS server and will cache the results for a set amount of time. This is the TTL or Time To Live. Next time the ISP DNS Server will be able to reply directly without needing to forward requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This forwarding and caching is what makes making a DNS change not instantaneous. The TTL needs to be reached so that no results are still being fetched from the cache of DNS servers across the globe.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dns-records">DNS Records&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#dns-records">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now we know roughly how DNS works let’s look at the most common type of records&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#a">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A (Host) records are the most simple records which translate domain names to IPs&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eg &lt;a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.google.com&lt;/a>
to 216.58.204.14&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="cname">CNAME&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#cname">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is different to an A record in that it maps a domain name to another domain name when no A record exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eg &lt;a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.google.com&lt;/a>
to somethingelse.google.com&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically Azure makes use of CNAMEs for many of its services especially adding a custom domain name&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="mx">MX&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#mx">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>MX stands for Mail Exchange and is used for configuring email&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="name-server">Name Server&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#name-server">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Every domain has a number of Name Servers which tells you what servers control the DNS settings for that domain. If you change your Name Servers then the new Name servers will be where you can change your DNS settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to use a service like &lt;a href="https://dnsimple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNSimple&lt;/a>
instead of &lt;a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">123reg&lt;/a>
or where ever you registered your domain then all you need to do is change your Name servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="aaaa">AAAA&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#aaaa">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Like A record but for ipv6&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-next">What next?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-next">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Want to put some different DNS records into practise? Buy a domain name and publish some content to it. Check out my previous post about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/creating-dns-records-programmatically">programmatically adding records&lt;/a>
. Want an SSL certificate? Get a wildcard one and then you can apply it to any subdomain you add to your domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a new website you want to publish consider which of the following is better:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com/newsite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.example.com/newsite&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://newsite.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://newsite.example.com&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I much prefer the second option, it looks cleaner, there is no potential conflict with the parent site, no subfolder issues between production and development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code Reviews</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/codereviews/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/codereviews/</guid><description>&lt;p>Reviewing code is a great habit to get into. Code reviews help share knowledge between your team members and help catch bugs before they get into production. But how do you get into the habit of reviewing and avoid the we don’t have time to do this mentality?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) has some great options that can help make code reviews second nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#pull-requests">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of source control systems have the concept of pull requests. This is where you request others to review your code usually in a branch and if they approve it, merge it into a main branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create a pull request in VSTS go to the Code section and select Pull Requests. Often VSTS will make a suggestion of what branch to make a pull request for, if you don’t see this just click the New Pull request button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Select a branch you want to merge from and a branch that should be merged into (usually you merge into master from a feature branch). Give your pull request a title and description and select who should review your code, this can either be an individual or a group of people. You can also review all the changes that will be reviewed so you can make any last minute changes before it is reviewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you are anything like me you want your code merged in as soon as you have created your pull request and there is nothing stopping you reviewing your own code and clicking approve and merge on your own pull request. However &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/git/branch-policies?view=vsts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branch policies&lt;/a>
is a way around this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="branch-policies">Branch Policies&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#branch-policies">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Branch Policy" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/save-policy-changes.png?resize=599%2C901&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Branch policies allow you to specify how your code gets merged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to the list of branches in VSTS and select branch policy and you will see a whole host of options to customise the merge process. If you do this on the master branch you will not be able to commit any changes to master without it going through a pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first option enables you to select how many reviewers are needed on your code. If no one else works on your project best not setting this, but for everyone else setting at least one person to review your code is a great practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next you can ensure that your pull request is linked to a work item, this helps keep ensure you are actually fixing issues and not just making change for the sake of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check for comment resolution is a good setting to enable. This ensures that if your reviewer has commented about you needing to change this line here, it ensures that you do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enforce merge strategy allows you to choose between fast forward merge or squash merge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Build validation enables the code to be built using a build definition you have configured. This is a great way to check code builds or tests pass before it gets merged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last two options allow you to specify code reviewers and third party external services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Android Development Options</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/android-development-options/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/android-development-options/</guid><description>&lt;p>A friend asked me how to get started in Android Development and I thought I might have a go at answering that question here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am by no means an expert in Android development, I do have an app in the play store so I know something.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="manifest-file">Manifest File&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#manifest-file">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is probably the easiest option and also doesn’t actually create an android app so I am not sure if it should be included in this list of not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a website and you want to create an app for that you could just create a manifest file and add this to your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once your website has a manifest file, if you visit your website using a mobile phone or tablet you will get the option to add a shortcut to the home screen. You then have an app like experience in that you can click an icon to launch your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A manifest file is a simple text file which specifies a few settings like the icon size, filename, what page loads when clicked and name of your “app”&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="visual-studio">Visual Studio&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#visual-studio">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is the option I know most about as is what I have used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are familiar with Visual Studio you can use the Xamarin Forms software to create your app in C#. Xamarin Forms allows you to easily create cross platform apps that run on Android, IOS and windows phone. So far I have only experimented with Android but it should be relatively easy to extend my code to run on other platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xamarin Forms allows you to write one a single codebase that can be compiled to run on the different platforms. Xamarin requires the use of XAML a XML like markup language for designing UI elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More Information on &lt;a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://www.xamarin.com/forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xamarin Forms&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="android-studio">Android Studio&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#android-studio">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I don’t know much about this option so do correct me if I don’t get the details correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Android Studio can be downloaded from Google this allows you to create java code to run directly on an android device. From what I know this is fairly similar experience to Visual Studio but instead of writing your code in C# you use Android Studio and write it directly in java.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More information&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="cordova">Cordova&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#cordova">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Cordova allows you to use HTML, CSS and javascript to create cross platform apps. I have no idea why I haven’t heard of this technology until today as it sounds very flexible especially if you know a little bit of javascript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More information&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize there are lots of different options available to create an android app. What you choose depends on what you want to build, what language and experience you have and if your app needs to be cross platform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tips for Developing Yourself</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/tips-for-developing-yourself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/tips-for-developing-yourself/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while I have been mentoring a friend and I thought I might share some top tips I have implemented in my career so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="hard-work">Hard Work&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#hard-work">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>At school I was told: “&lt;em>Only in the dictionary does Success come before Work&lt;/em>“. Yes it is a bit of a corny saying however it has stuck in my head and it’s true. If you want to get anywhere you need to work at it. For many years I just drifted along, but as soon as I knuckled down and worked hard my career started going somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="write-a-blog">Write a Blog&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#write-a-blog">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Writing is an important skill that you need to work at to improve. If you commit to writing one blog post a week this will help to improve this skill. Even after 150+ blog posts I still feel I need to improve. Not only that it will also help others learn something from you and shows a willingness to contribute to the community. If a Hiring Manager reads your blog he can see some of the stuff you know or care about and may help give you the edge over more experienced candidates.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#soft-skills">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>This is one I need to work on but you should concentrate on the so called “&lt;em>Soft Skills&lt;/em>“. Soft Skills are the skills you have for dealing with others. Are you good at talking to people? Or good at getting requirements out of business owners? If so you have some soft skills, don’t underestimate the value that these bring to a team and keep developing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="build-a-side-project">Build a Side Project&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#build-a-side-project">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Start building a side project, it doesn’t matter what it is but start building something. I started building a Xamarin app but I have learnt loads of other connected things while doing this, ViewModels, APIs, Build and Deployment processes, Azure Functions. It also gives you ammunition for things to blog about. If you are short of ideas try solving a problem or rebuild something you use.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="use-your-spare-time">Use your spare time&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#use-your-spare-time">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>During the day there are moments you can reclaim for learning stuff. There are lots of &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/podcasts">podcast&lt;/a>
which discuss useful development topics, listen to these while driving to work. Subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/pluralsight">pluralsight&lt;/a>
and listen to this while washing up. Don’t get too concerned with learning everything, however think how much more you are learning than not listening at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="im-not-ready">I’m not ready!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#im-not-ready">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>We are never ready to take that next step, it is so easy to make excuses like I need to learn x, or know y. The only way to know if you are ready is to try and to keep trying. Iterate as you go so you keep improving yourself. If you wait before you start trying you will end up waiting forever. If you start trying now you will make some small progress and have a better idea of what you need to do to achieve your goals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heroes</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/heroes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/heroes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Who was your hero growing up?&lt;/strong> Mine was Stephen Hawking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Stephen Hawking" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Hawking-ZeroG_web-1.jpg?resize=662%2C268&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is a hero?&lt;/strong> A lot is said in the media about “Heroes”. Often the sportsperson of the hour is described as a hero. I don’t like this definition and I think there is far more to being a hero than that. One definition I saw describes a hero as &lt;em>A person who is admired for their courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why Hawking?&lt;/strong> As a kid I thought I was pretty smart (Not really just above average), I liked Star Trek and science so Hawking was a pretty obvious choice. I remember reading all about Hawking and his life fascinated me. A brilliant man was struck down by motor neurone disease in his early twenties, however this did not stop him and he completed his doctorate and became the famous physicist we all know and love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My physics career was fairly short lived ending with an undergraduate course at University of York, however I really enjoyed learning the concepts that he described about space and time and was definitely a driving factor for me to learn as much as I did about Physics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How heroic is it to be given 2 years to live and then not only survive but to expand our understanding of the universe without being able to speak or move without the aid of technology?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can not imagine what it must be like to not be able to communicate without the use of a computer, but this has been Stephen Hawkings world for over 30 years. His computer system has undergone various upgrades over the years however his synthetic computer voice has continued as he identified with it and prefered it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stephen Hawking had an immense intellect, I would probably describe him as one of the cleverest people on the planet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Who are your heroes?&lt;/strong> What kind of person is your hero, is it a scientist or engineer? The world contains some very clever people who will inspire and excite young people to strive towards something. I am hopeful that my sons can be inspired even if it’s only a small way by someone like Stephen Hawking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New version of Pwned Pass</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/new-version-pwned-pass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/new-version-pwned-pass/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Pwned Pass" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qZTLiWRfQwS7pT6gExLMTvU1pl8NtTU-kbeoSzD68p1D-EPY3Pg7cz2AN66QJpTTp1c=h900-rw" loading="lazy"
/>
A new version of Pwned Pass is available from &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troy Hunt&lt;/a>
released V2 of Pwned Pass onto his &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haveibeenpwned&lt;/a>
website. There are now over half a billion passwords that have appeared in data breaches for you to search.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time Troy has included information about how many times a password has appeared in his data. So “password” returns a value of 3,303,003 so is a really, really bad choice of password to use. However the password “windows 10” has only appeared twice so is much better, however I would still recommend avoiding using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the great things about the internet is that on the day of release I was tweeting Troy so I could get my android app updated to take advantage of these new features. I even helped him identify an issue with the documentation on his site. He has also kindly add a link to my app onto his website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That conversation and link has lead to a massive increase in app downloads. Before I was going steady on about 14 installs, now I have 86 active installs. I am not sure if this will increase anymore but if you are reading this because you downloaded my app, then thank you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My app has four main features:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Password Check – this allows you to search a password and see if it has appeared in a data breach and also the number of times that password has appeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Email Check – this allows you to search your email address and see which data breach it has been involved in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>List of Data Breaches – this lists the data breaches from haveibeenpwned.com you can also sort by Date Added, Number of accounts and name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calendar of Breaches – this shows a github like chart of what days breaches are added&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you like my app do let me know. I have received a few ratings on google play it would be great to get a few more. If you want me to add a feature or have ideas of how I could improve it let me know as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To download take a look at &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords&lt;/a>

By huge I mean 77 if statements one after the other, each if checks to see what page id you are on and loads different content. This is not easy to maintain and I want to refactor it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One option would be to replace the if statements with a switch block. However this is just as unmanageable as the huge if block. Lets look at a better option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Polymorphism&lt;/strong> is where you create a base class and then create sub classes from it. In my case I created an interface IPage with a single method CreateContent.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">interface&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">IPage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> CreatePageContent();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and then create 77 classes for each page which implemented this single method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now comes the fun bit how do I call the correct page class from my original code?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a dictionary than maps page ids to the class names.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> Dictionary&amp;lt;PageIds, Type&amp;gt; PageIdToClass = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Dictionary&amp;lt;PageIds, Type&amp;gt;()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> PageIds.HomePage,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(HomePage)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> },
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> PageIds.ContactPage,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(ContactPage)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> },
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc &lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is the one step I am not 100% happy with as I think it may be possible to remove or simplify this step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I have a way to map ids to classes I can write a class to do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">MyPage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> IPage &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> MyPage(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> pageId)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> PageIds p = (PageIds)pageId;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Type t = PageIdToClass[p];
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> ConstructorInfo constructor = t.GetConstructor(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Type[] { });
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = (IPage)constructor.Invoke(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Create()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo.CreatePageContent();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So in my constructor I take the pageId and pass it to my dictionary to get which subclass to load. I then get its Constructor and invoke it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I can remove the huge if block and replace it with a single line of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> page = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> MyPage(pageId);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>On the face of it this change might look like a lot of work for not much gain as we started off with one file and now we have the original file, an interface, 77 subclasses and the MyPage class. However the original file is a lot more manageable and each sub class can be altered independently of each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a big step towards making this code more maintainable, there is always more that can be done but that can wait for another day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chrome distrusts SSL Certificates</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/ssl-distrusts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/ssl-distrusts/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the websites I have been working on has been displaying an error in the console. The error reads as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>The SSL certificate used to load resources from https://example.com will be distrusted in M70. Once distrusted, users will be prevented from loading these resources. See https://g.co/chrome/symantecpkicerts for more information.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>But what does this mean? Well let’s start by looking at the &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/chromes-plan-to-distrust-symantec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link&lt;/a>
provided.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In January 2017 it was revealed that Certificate Authorities run by Symantec which include Thawte, VeriSign, Equifax, GeoTrust, and RapidSSL had been issuing certificates that did not comply with baseline standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting with Chrome 66, Google has decided to remove trust for these certificates. Chrome 66 is due for release around 17th April. My error mentions M70 so what does that refer to?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chrome 70 which is due to be released in October 2018 will removed the trust for another batch of Symantec certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are getting one of these errors because you are using a certificate that is going to be distrusted what will your site look like in Chrome 66 or Chrome 70?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well Chrome 66 is now in the dev channel so we can give it a try. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tempsnip.png.jpg?resize=662%2C443&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not very nice for your users is it? Now is the time to order a new SSL certificate to avoid this happening to your site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first saw this error a few months ago and have been reading up about it and waiting for Chrome 66 to reach the dev channel so I could test what it did to my site. However now that I have Chrome 66 installed I spotted the intranet for the company I work for is also affected. I do not directly work on the intranet so I notified the security team that they may want to look into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately the response I received has been that Google needs to fix this before Chrome 66 is released. I am not criticising my employer or the security team, however this isn’t something Google can just “ &lt;strong>fix&lt;/strong> “.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The certificates issued were issued by a CA that had issues so in order to maintain the trustworthiness of all certificates Google had little choice but to distrust them. Google and security experts need to be making more of a fuss about this and I am joining in on making a fuss by writing this blog. &lt;a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/are-you-ready-for-the-symantec-distrust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Helme&lt;/a>
estimates that there are about 7000 websites which may be affected by the M66 and M70 distrusts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Content Security Policies</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/content-security-policies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/content-security-policies/</guid><description>&lt;p>A content Security Policy or CSP is a HTTP response header that defines what sources of content can be loaded on a web page. It is a way to combat Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-xss-attack-then">What is a XSS attack then?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#what-is-a-xss-attack-then">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you load a webpage it also loads various other resources like images, some css style sheets, various javascript files that you want to run and probably many other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you know that you can trust all of these things? If you created them and they live under you control then the answer is probably yes. However these days you will probably want to use resources from across the internet, like youtube videos, google analytics, disqus comments, jquery libraries from a cdn etc and you can’t be sure exactly what they are doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine you had a page which you could add any text into a form which would then be displayed. A malicious user could add evil javascript or get the browser to load evil code from anywhere on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="csp-to-the-rescue">CSP to the rescue!&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#csp-to-the-rescue">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A CSP allows the browser to only load from sources that you specify. You could specify that resources from your own site will load but the evil script will not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at some examples&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy: script-src &amp;#39;self&amp;#39;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This allows &lt;code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags to only load from the current webhost. script-src is not the only keyword you can use, let’s look at some of the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>script-src&lt;/strong> – control what &lt;code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>style-src&lt;/strong> – control what css will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>img-src&lt;/strong> – control what images will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>frame-src&lt;/strong> – control what frames will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>font-src&lt;/strong> – control what fonts will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>object-src&lt;/strong> – control what object tags will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>connect-src&lt;/strong> – control what resources a script can connect to&lt;br>
&lt;strong>media-src&lt;/strong> – controls what media (audio/video) will load&lt;br>
&lt;strong>default-src&lt;/strong> – if no specific rule exists then the default directive will run&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This allows any content to be loaded from any site as long as it comes from a secure (https) site&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https://example.com
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This allows any content to be loaded from &lt;a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://example.com&lt;/a>
only.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-this-on-my-site">How do I use this on my site?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#how-do-i-use-this-on-my-site">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have added CSPs into my web.config which works great for my .Net Framework code.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code> &amp;lt;system.webServer&amp;gt; &amp;lt;httpProtocol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;customHeaders&amp;gt; &amp;lt;add name=&amp;#34;Content-Security-Policy&amp;#34; value=&amp;#34;default-src https://example.com&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/customHeaders&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/httpProtocol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/system.webServer&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>For .net core it is a bit more complex as you don’t tend to use web.config files, however check out Anthony Chu’s &lt;a href="https://anthonychu.ca/post/aspnet-core-csp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post&lt;/a>
, which has a solution to that problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="report-only">Report Only&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#report-only">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One last thing about CSPs to mention is the Report Only flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This does the same as the above but doesn’t enforce anything, so you can fix any problems before you break anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To view your issues just look in the developer tools in your favourite browser. Or you can configure all your reports to be collated in one place with a report-uri directive.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https://example.com; report-uri https://example.report-uri.com/r/d/csp/reportOnly;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Scott Helme and Troy Hunt have a site called &lt;a href="https://report-uri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report-uri&lt;/a>
which offer a service for collating and viewing all your CSP violations so check it out if you want to know more about CSPs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pluralsight</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/pluralsight/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/pluralsight/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this year I signed up for pluralsight. If you want to sign up to pluralsight as well use this link &lt;a href="http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4&lt;/a>
to get money off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pluralsight is a website that sells training videos on a wide variety of technical topics. You sign up for a monthly or annual subscription and you can watch over 6000 courses whenever and where ever you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not a big fan of videos as if I am sat in front of a screen I would rather be building something, however I do spend a lot of time listening to podcasts. So I have decided to convert this time to listening to pluralsight videos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we assume that by not seeing the visual portion of the videos you lose out on 75% of the learning (This is just a guesstimate I am not sure what the exact figure is or how you would calculate it). However this is still 25% more learning than if I hadn’t signed up at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I signed up I have listened to over 27 hours of technical videos. These have covered topics like C#, Security, Xamarin, MVVM, Interfaces, Getting Involved and Clean architecture. The number one thing I have learnt is that there is a lot that I still don’t understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said I would like to think that since starting to listen to pluralsight concepts have gone from being unknown unknowns (I don’t know about them and I don’t understand them) to known unknowns (I know about them but don’t yet fully understand them)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To keep track of your learning pluralsight has some tests which you can complete. I am particularly proud of my score on the Azure test which ranks me as an expert.&lt;/p>

, and how useful they are for producing good quality maintainable code. Let’s look at a problem and the solution I came up with which I am quite proud of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As previously mentioned I am in the process of moving &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2018/01/22/moving-blobs-cloud-suppliers/">images&lt;/a>
from AWS to Azure blob storage. Now that the actual files themselves have been moved I need to change the code that references them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I could find all the code that uses the AWS API and replace it with the Azure API but I am not very good at predicting the future, we may stay on Azure for a while, we may move to AWS or Google Cloud, or we may want to go back to files sitting on a server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets try and code a solution that is as flexible as possible. As you have probably guessed I am going to create an interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first I thought about creating an interface called &lt;strong>ICloudStorage&lt;/strong> , however this isn’t flexible enough as what happens if we go back to sticking files on a server so instead I created &lt;strong>IStorage&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created three classes that implemented IStorage, &lt;strong>AWSStorage&lt;/strong> , &lt;strong>AzureStorage&lt;/strong> and mostly for testing at the moment &lt;strong>FileStorage&lt;/strong>. I then created a class Storage that would call these three classes. Initially I created it like this&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Storage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> IStorage &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Storage(IStorage repo)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However this would require I call it like Storage(new AzureStorage()) and I would need to know everywhere in my code which implementation I want to use. This isn’t too bad as when we change from AWS to Azure we would need to do a find and replace throughout the code and replace all AWSStorage and make them AzureStorage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However we can do better than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Storage&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> IStorage &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Storage()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Type obj = Type.GetType(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;DefaultStorageRepository&amp;#34;&lt;/span>]);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> ConstructorInfo constructor = obj.GetConstructor(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Type[] { });
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = (IStorage)constructor.Invoke(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">null&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This code will read from the web.config which implementation to use and that will decide which class to call. This means that to change from AWS to Azure we do not need to redeploy any code, all we need to do is change the web.config.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at the three lines and see if we can understand what is happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Type.GetType()&lt;/strong> looks straight forward and gets the type from the web.config&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>obj.GetConstructor()&lt;/strong> This gets the constructor for the type we have just found.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>constructor.Invoke&lt;/strong> This then invokes the constructor and it then gets cast to the interface so can be used by the _repo variable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all fairly simple and makes sense, however it has produced some very flexible code and allows the code to be extended without recompiling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at a hypothetical example. We want to add support for Google Cloud Storage. All we need to do is create a class library which implements the IStorage interface, place the compiled binary in the website and update the web.config to reference it. I haven’t tried this hypothetical example so it might be more complex than I think but in theory it should work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am pretty excited at how flexible this code can be, hopefully I will use code like this more often now I understand it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving files into blob storage</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/moving-blobs-cloud-suppliers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/moving-blobs-cloud-suppliers/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are in the process of moving our companies websites onto the Azure platform. One of the challenges was to move image files out of the website project into blob storage. This week I have moved 150,000 of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I keep banging on about is that your source code should not contain data. If it does every time you do a deployment you need to consider where these images are located and ensure you don’t overwrite or loose any. It also goes without saying that deployments of a few Mb are a lot quicker than deployments of 100s of Mb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure blob storage also gives you advantages like distributing storage across multiple datacenters which would be impossible with traditional files on a server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now that we have established that this is a good idea lets look at how we could move large amounts of data. In my case all the filenames are stored in a SQL database so the plan of action was to simply loop through the files in the database, download from current storage (either locally or other cloud storage), upload to Azure and tidy up afterwards. Due to the number of images I am going to update the database and mark when a file has been processed so I can do the move over several days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> source = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://example.com/images/&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>db.SaveChanges();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (Directory.Exists(tmp))

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Directory.Delete(tmp, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>First of all I create a tmp folder in the root of my website if it doesn’t exist to store my images temporarily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use an entity framework model to query the database that haven’t been moved, and I use the take() method to limit how many results I process. (I have been passing in 1000 at a time)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then use a foreach loop over all these files to perform the following actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create additional subfolders if the filename variable stored in the database isn’t actually a filename but a filepath, note you will have to split filename and filepath which I haven’t included code for here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download file from the original url and save into the temporary folder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upload to Azure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Delete temporary file&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Update database giving a success or fail&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once the foreach is finished I commit the database changes and delete the temporary folder. I am sure there must be other ways to do this transfer but this was quick and easy to setup and now I have a copy of all the files in Azure storage so I can test out other issues with my website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last tip about how to schedule this code. I called the above code from a MVC controller and then wrote a Azure Function to call this code on a schedule.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website UI Testing</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/website-ui-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/website-ui-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I looked at testing the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/funkysi1701/mobile-app-ui-testing-jgg-temp-slug-9433902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI of mobile apps&lt;/a>
, this week lets look at how we could do a similar thing for websites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing the user interface is not an excuse for a lack of &lt;a href="https://dev.to/funkysi1701/writing-your-first-test-53gi-temp-slug-2645725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unit tests&lt;/a>
. Testing the user interface takes longer so for keep creating your small unit tests that can be run after ever build. That said lets look at how you create a UI test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a Unit Test project as normal. Now install the following nuget packages&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriverSelenium.WebDriverSelenium.WebDriver.PhantomJS.Xplatform
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I am going to be using Selenium to achieve my website testing and I am going to concentrate on the Chrome browser. However packages exist for other browsers so have a look at the following and I expect there are others as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Selenium.WebDriver.IEDriverSelenium.Firefox.WebDriver
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium&lt;/a>
started life as a plugin for Firefox to help create automated tests, however the latest version of Firefox is not compatible with the plugin as I write this. I have not had to install any plugins or extensions to my browsers to achieve my testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough talk lets write a test. First we create two instance variables to store the baseURL and the driver for the browser you are using.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> baseURL = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.example.com/&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> RemoteWebDriver driver;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next we need to set things up for the test to run. This creates an instance of the chrome driver, maximizes the window and sets it to wait 30 seconds before timing out.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[TestInitialize()]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> MyTestInitialize()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ChromeDriver();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Manage().Window.Maximize();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitlyWait(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">30&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now comes the actual test. We navigate to a URL and then compare the title of the page loaded with a know value with a Assert statement like you would find in a unit test.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[TestMethod]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> CheckBrowserTitle()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">this&lt;/span>.baseURL);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Assert.AreEqual(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Home Page&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, driver.Title);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Finally we need to tidy up after ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">[TestCleanup()]&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> MyTestCleanup()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> driver.Quit();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you are used to writing tests you will know that the are usually constructed in three sections Arrange, Act and Assert. The Arrange is done in the initialize method, which makes the actual test much simpler, the first line does the Act and the last line does the Assert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have written a simple test lets look at something more complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>driver.FindElementByLinkTest(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;click&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This finds any Link on the page which is click. Be careful as the string need to be exactly what appears on screen it may well be easier to specify by id or class or something that doesn’t change as often. By adding .click() on the end of this command Selenium will click on the link and you can navigate to a new page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What about submitting form data?&lt;/strong> Well you can find the element you want to fill in and add .SendKeys(&amp;ldquo;example text&amp;rdquo;) or .Submit() and this will fill in and submit form data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What about a screenshot?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Screenshot ss = driver.GetScreenshot();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ss.SaveAsFile(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test.jpg&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have only just started playing around with web UI tests but you can see there is a fair bit you can do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mobile App UI Testing</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/mobile-app-ui-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/mobile-app-ui-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since I started creating an android app I have been writing simple UI tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been taking advantage of the Visual Studio App Center which allows you to test against hundreds of different devices in the &lt;strong>Test Cloud&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Xamarin UI tests" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01-newproject-vs.png?resize=300%2C182&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
In order to write a UI test create a UI Test App, this makes use of the nuget package Xamarin UI Test. By default you will now have a test called AppLaunches which will take a screenshot of you app after it starts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can now run this test against any device from Visual Studio assuming you have it physically plugged into your machine. However, how do you run against the Test Cloud?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To run against the Test Cloud you need to first install node.js. Now you can install the appcenter cli with the following command.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>**npm** install -g appcenter-cli
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>To run the tests in the Test Cloud run the following command&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>**appcenter** test run uitest --app &amp;#34;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;appname&amp;gt;&amp;#34; --devices &amp;#34;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;deviceset&amp;gt;&amp;#34; --app-path _pathToFile.apk_ --test-series &amp;#34;master&amp;#34; --locale &amp;#34;en_US&amp;#34; --build-dir _pathToUITestBuildDir_
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>where &lt;username> is your appcenter username, is the name of your app in appcenter and is the group of apps you have created in app center to test against.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look at device sets in the test section of the appcenter and click the new device set button. You can then search for any device you like and add it to a set, as I write this there are 244 devices you can test against.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is currently not possible within app center to run tests against a new build, however if you build your app in VSTS as well you can create build or release step that runs it. As the Visual Studio app center is still under development I wouldn’t be surprised if it is added at some point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In VSTS look for Mobile Center Test in the definitions and you can specify the same variables as specified in the command line above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now how do you actually write a useful UI test? I mentioned above you get a default test which contains the following code, this takes a screenshot of your app. However you don’t have to include this when using the Test Cloud as screenshots are included for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>app.Screenshot(&amp;#34;First screen.&amp;#34;);
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Lets look at what else is included in app&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>app.Repl();
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This starts an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) which lets you explore what is on screen in your app and pauses execution. I don’t include this in my tests, however I do make use of it to explore what is on screen and what tests I might make use of.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>app.Tap(c =&amp;gt; c.Marked(&amp;#34;Button&amp;#34;));
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This taps an element on screen called Button. There is also a method called TapCoordinates which would allow you to click anywhere you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>app.WaitForElement(c =&amp;gt; c.Marked(&amp;#34;View&amp;#34;));
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>After clicking a button you are probably going to want to wait for the app to load extra data or a new screen. The WaitForElement waits for an element to appear on screen. There are also methods that wait a period of time or wait until an element no longer exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main methods I have used so far, however there is an extensive list including methods for scrolling, swiping, pinching and adjusting the volume buttons. So you should be able to test all manner of app functionality and if you make use of the Test Clouds will know which devices are causing problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lets see what 2018 can do!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-see-2018-can/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2018/lets-see-2018-can/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is 2018 so it must be time to think about what my plans and goals are for the new year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buy-a-house">Buy a house&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#buy-a-house">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="House" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LEGO-Classic-10703-Creative-Building-Box-Yellow-House.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This a huge goal for me. For many years I was content with renting and thought owning my own home wasn’t for me, but then I went and started a family and my career started going in the right direction and my thoughts about this have changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is going to take a lot of work to make this goal happen in 2018. First I need to save enough money for the deposit, which is far from easy with a wife and two children. Second I need to get our current place sorted ready to physically move which again won’t be easy. Third I need to make a decision which will affect where I live for the next 25 years. At the moment I am torn between the size of property and its physical location, I need to balance both of these and meet the requirements from the rest of the family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do think this is an achievable goal so wish me luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="progress-in-my-career">Progress in my career&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#progress-in-my-career">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I need to be careful how I phrase this in case past, current or future employers are reading. I have been working hard at my current role for over a year and I am starting to wonder what is next for me. I am not entirely sure what form this is going to take yet, I have a few ideas on the go and hopefully I can reveal more soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another one that is very achievable, as long as I have it in the back of my mind as the year goes on progress should be made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="see-more-of-family">See more of family&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#see-more-of-family">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I recently missed a family celebration due to the expansion of my own family and it reminded me that there are aunts, uncles and cousins that I haven’t seen in years and it would be nice to reconnect. Also as my own boys get older and are learning to interact it would be great if they could get to know my own family better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t have a clear idea how to achieve this one as it takes two but I am going to make more of an effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">Celebrate 5 years of marriage&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-5-years-of-marriage">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Wow how has it been five years since we got married? At some point in 2018 I will take time out from the usual and spend it with the wife away from the boys. I won’t give away more details as I want that to be a surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celebrate-the-birth-of-my-two-sons">Celebrate the birth of my two sons&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#celebrate-the-birth-of-my-two-sons">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Celebrate James and Edward" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/james5.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t want to get my boys christened as I would like them to make up their own minds when they are old enough, however I do want to celebrate all that they are with a thanksgiving service. Not sure when we are going to sort this, however it is my hope that it will be soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="family-holiday">Family holiday&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#family-holiday">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not much of a goal but in the summer I will take time out to spend a week away with the family. In previous years we have done scotland, wales and northumberland. This year I am thinking of somewhere not too far away as Edward is still small, but maybe near where I grew up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightning-talk">Lightning Talk&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#lightning-talk">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A lightning talk is a very short talk or presentation given at a conference or user group. Friends of mine are having lots of success talking about what they know about and I think it might be time for me to have a go. I am not a natural public speaker so this is a step out of my comfort zone, however I am going to start small and see what happens. At the moment I don’t know what my subject or topic is going to be, my suspicion is that it will be devops related as that interest me more but watch this space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back at 2017</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/looking-back-at-2017/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/looking-back-at-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>As 2017 starts to draw to a close let’s look at some of the highlights from the past year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Edward" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC_0376-e1510563039193-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Edward&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In November I became a father again and celebrated the arrival of Edward into the world. Before the birth I was worried how well my first son James would adapt to the new arrival but I am happy to say I didn’t need to, he mostly ignores the new arrival.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Star Trek&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In September the latest Star Trek TV series Discovery arrived on Netflix. I have been very positive so far about the show, I am still positive however there are things that annoy me about the new show, however I am keen to see the next episode each week so they are definitely doing something right.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Office move&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In May I helped my employer move to brand new &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/office-move" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offices&lt;/a>
. This was a lot of hard work, but everything went as planned and our new home is great.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Side projects &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Google Play" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/googleplay.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I blogged in February about having a side project but it wasn’t until later in the year that this solidified into what I am working on now. It started as a way to understand &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/interfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interfaces&lt;/a>
this then led to learning Xamarin and creating an android app to help promote this blog. Troy Hunt expanded his HIBP API to include passwords that have been in data breaches, I then started working on &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/pwned-pass--available-from-the-play-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pwned passwords&lt;/a>
which is a simple android frontend for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Learning R&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In Feb I also experimented with a new programming language &lt;a href="https://funkysi1701.com/learning-r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R&lt;/a>
. It started with a problem about converting exchange rates and ended with a SQL stored procedure that executed some R code, I still want to learn lots more but it was a good example of the sorts of thing you can build with R.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>DNS programmatically&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>One of my most successful blogs was about how you can create &lt;a href="https://dev.to/funkysi1701/creating-dns-records-programmatically-1o3c-temp-slug-3062796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dns&lt;/a>
records within your application eg sites that have yourname.domain in the url. It was a great chance to look at how dns works and learn more about what azure can do to manage this. I want to expand on this and build something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that was 2017, for some ideas about what 2018 might have in store for me look out for my next blog post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting started with Azure Table Storage</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-table-storage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-table-storage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Azure Table storage is cheap way to store data, however it has some drawbacks that you should be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure Table storage is a simple way to store NoSQL data with key/attribute pairs. I am very familiar with storing data in SQL databases and would still choose SQL over Table storage, however Table storage is significantly cheaper so could be worth investigating depending on your project.&lt;/p>

makes use of Table storage for his Have I been pwned? website so there are projects out there that make use of it to great affect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work with Table storage you need to use a nuget package &lt;strong>WindowsAzure.Storage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Install-Package WindowsAzure.Storage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To load data from a Table in Azure Table storage I use the following code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;tablename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TableOperation retrieveOperation = TableOperation.Retrieve&amp;lt;Entity&amp;gt;(PartitionKey, Rowkey);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>table.CreateIfNotExists();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TableResult retrievedResult = table.Execute(retrieveOperation);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Example eg = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Example();

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> eg;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You need to create a class (called Entity in the example above) derived from TableEntity which defines the Partitionkey and Rowkey, plus and other columns you want to store in table storage. The row key and partition key uniquely identify the data in the table, think of this as the primary key of the table if you are used to SQL. This class must also contain a parameterless constructor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the only way to retrieve data, using the partitionkey and rowkey. If you want to retrieve a specific piece of data you would need to retrieve all rows and then search them for what you need. For me this is not a big problem as I only have 150 rows but if you have millions of rows you may need to think carefully how to use this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To save data I use a very similar piece of code&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(path);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudTableClient tableClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;tablename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Entity post = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Entity(ID, DateTime.Now);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TableOperation insertOperation = TableOperation.InsertOrReplace(post);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>table.CreateIfNotExists();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>table.Execute(insertOperation);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I create a Entity object and then pass this as a parameter into the InsertOrReplace method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To delete data it is also very similar, you create an entity object and pass this as a parameter to the Delete method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When debugging my table storage code I found the &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/storage-explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Storage Explorer&lt;/a>
very useful for seeing what data actually existed in the table and what might be throwing an error, usually something wrong with my Entity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mentioned earlier that Table Storage was cheaper than SQL Azure. Well for my simple playing about with things I have found my monthly charge of £10+ has been reduced to £1+ If I were to build anything that is more than just me learning about how it works I would probably continue to use SQL but for the cost of learning new tech it is well worth giving table storage a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to get Zero Code Changes outside of Source Control</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/get-zero-code-changes-outside-source-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/get-zero-code-changes-outside-source-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>Source control is bread and butter for web developers, however not so much for SQL developers and other business people. One of my goals for the coming year is to get the whole of my team using source control processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the arguments against using source control is there will always be a few exceptions where it won’t be used. Lets look at a few scenarios to help make the case for source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario One&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web Dev 1 makes a change in production to fix an issue and doesn’t use source control. Web Dev 2 is working on a new feature and makes use of source control. He is given the sign-off to deploy his new feature and in the process undoes Web Dev 1’s fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management blames Web Dev 2 as they “broke” stuff during the deployment. Web Dev 2 doesn’t understand what happened and Web Dev 1 is oblivious to the entire scenario despite in reality being part of the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario Two&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A SQL Dev works all night to fix a problem. He deploy to production and doesn’t notice a missed where clause due to lack of sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s look at these two scenarios done with the whole team buying into source control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario One&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web Dev 1 makes a change in production to fix an issue and also commits to source control. This takes him an extra 5 minutes (if that!) Web Dev 2 is working on a new feature and makes use of source control. He is given the sign-off to deploy his new feature and in the process merges Web Dev 1’s fix before he deploys to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management is happy with Web Dev 1, nothing is broken and new functionality has made the website better not worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scenario Two&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A SQL Dev works all night to fix a problem. He deploy to production and doesn’t notice a missed where clause due to lack of sleep, he also commits to source control this takes him an extra 5 minutes (if that!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the morning a colleague looks through the commits made during the night and queries the missing where clause. A fix is made in source control and deployed, management and the client are unaware that a problem was created and fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are simple scenarios but I cannot think of any situation where the outcome would be better to not use source control. These examples assume no continuous deployment, adding this to the system before every team has bought into source control would cause bugs and issues all over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However with a team that is 100% behind source control continuous deployment can achieve an amazing productivity boost. After every commit code could be automatically tested, reviewed by other members of the team and deployed to test environments for further analysis. Only tested code that has been reviewed can get anywhere near production environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said all this there are ways especially on the SQL side to mitigate loosing changes while you work on training individuals and convincing management. Before any code is deployed to production do a schema compare. If you only see changes you have made you can proceed, if you don’t shout at your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code Reviews&lt;br>
Team awareness of what is being changed&lt;br>
History of changes&lt;br>
Smoother Deployments&lt;br>
Automation&lt;br>
Better Teamwork&lt;br>
Diff changes between different versions&lt;br>
Many more&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disadvantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time to learn tools&lt;br>
Remember to commit changes&lt;br>
Technologies that use binary files harder to version control&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQL with Visual Studio Code</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-visual-studio-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/sql-visual-studio-code/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing SQL queries is typically done with SQL Management Studio (SSMS). However this tool is a bit of a beast so let’s look at how you could use Visual Studio Code instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visual Studio Code is a free text editor but it is so much more than just a text editor. VS Code can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com/Download&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work with SQL Server download the mssql extension. Press &lt;strong>CTRL+SHIFT+P&lt;/strong> and then Select &lt;strong>Install Extension&lt;/strong> and type &lt;strong>mssql&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intellisense in Visual Studio Code is brilliant, better than SSMS. Lets look at how to get it all set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new file and set the language type to SQL (Press &lt;strong>CTRL+K,M&lt;/strong> )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open the command palette, **CTRL+SHIFT+P ** and type SQL to show the mssql commands. Select the Connect command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then select &lt;strong>Create Connection Profile&lt;/strong> , this creates a profile to connect with your SQL Server. Follow the prompts to get it all setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look in the bottom right corner of the status bar and you should see you are connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you type sql you will see a long list of SQL code snippets that you could use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-sql-snippets.png?resize=662%2C348&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose a snippet to create, and edit it as required. When you are happy press **CTRL+SHIFT+E ** to execute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is basically all there is to it. However this is an incredibly powerful way of working, the intellisense instantly tells you what database objects you can use in your query and there is a wealth of different snippets you can use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When returning data you get a similar view to SSMS but you can save as Excel, CSV or JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SSMS is a very graphical way of doing things, you can double click a table and see its columns or indexes. VS Code relies on TSQL commands but you have access to exactly the same information.&lt;/p>

about learning about interfaces as I didn’t really understand the value of them. I do now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created an application that used interfaces so I could learn how it worked. I created a Logger Interface and created multiple classes that implemented that interface so I could swap out the different implementations easily. I created a SQL Logger and a File Logger and my code could be written and be completely unaware of which implementation it was using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This application uses SQL Azure and so I have a monthly bill to pay. Wouldn’t it be cool if I could reduce this bill? How about using the cheaper table storage instead?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Easy!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a new class that implements my interface and all I need to do is write the three methods defined in my interface and I can swap from SQL Azure to table storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit to interfaces is testing. Say I have an interface called inotification for sending notifications, I can have several implementations of this email, twitter, slack etc&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of these implementations should be used in unit tests, as you don’t want a tweet being sent every time you run your tests. Why not create an implementation that simply returns something for each method call and doesn’t actually do anything. I can then run my tests with my fake implementation which tests my code logic but not the implementation I have chosen (this can be tested later on with integration tests or user testing if required).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is pretty much all I have to say about interfaces. I just like how I can swap different implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It does take a bit of work to get the interface setup. I found that when writing the second implementation the interface would need to change slightly, mostly as it was badly designed to begin with. I think for beginners there may be some value to writing multiple implementations of an interface so you can be sure your interface is good, however I am sure with experience this will not be required.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating DNS records programmatically</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/creating-dns-records-programmatically/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/creating-dns-records-programmatically/</guid><description>&lt;p>DNS is the backbone of the internet. It converts domain names into IP addresses. But how can we do clever things with it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making DNS changes has always been a pain. You have to remember what company you registered your domain name with, then locate the login details for their website, login and fill in some web form and wait for the changes to replicate across the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are various websites that assign you a custom subdomain name like name.domain.com, obviously they must do this programmatically, they don’t have a guy following the above process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets see how we could do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first thought was to make use of the DNSimple API. &lt;a href="https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/&lt;/a>
The API allows all sort of DNS changes to be made, however this is a paid service so let’s look at other options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure now has a DNS section. You can go to the portal, add a DNS zone, and then add as many A, CNAME and MX records as you need. This is of course no better than doing it manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure offers a &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDK&lt;/a>
and an example Visual Studio project. Lets look at how it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you need to setup some credentials to use your Azure subscription. The easiest way to do this is with powershell.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Login&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>AzureRmAccount
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$sp = New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>DisplayName exampleapp &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>Password &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;{provide-password}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Sleep 20
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>New-AzureRmRoleAssignment &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>RoleDefinitionName Contributor &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">–&lt;/span>ServicePrincipalName $sp.ApplicationId
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will create a AD Service Principal which has access to your Azure subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to get the following IDs from the Azure portal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>subscriptionId for your subscription&lt;br>
tenantId or the Azure AD Directory ID&lt;br>
applicationId of the service principal created above&lt;br>
password you entered into the powershell script above&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> serviceCreds = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> ApplicationTokenProvider.LoginSilentAsync(tenantId, clientId, secret);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> dnsClient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> DnsManagementClient(serviceCreds);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>dnsClient.SubscriptionId = subscriptionId;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> recordSetParams = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> RecordSet();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>recordSetParams.TTL = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">3600&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>recordSetParams.ARecords = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> List&amp;lt;ARecord&amp;gt;();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>recordSetParams.ARecords.Add(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ARecord(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;1.2.3.4&amp;#34;&lt;/span>));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> recordSet = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> dnsClient.RecordSets.CreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;funkysi1701.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, RecordType.A, recordSetParams);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The above code connects to Azure and creates an A record for test.funkysi1701.com that points at the ip address 1.2.3.4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other DNS records can be created in a similar way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above example creates a new RecordSet but you can use the following to delete or get existing records.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> recordSet = dnsClient.RecordSets.Get(resourceGroupName, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;funkysi1701.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, RecordType.A);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>dnsClient.RecordSets.Delete(resourceGroupName, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;funkysi1701.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;test&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, RecordType.A);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now I have found out that I can write a console app to edit my DNS records I need to change the nameservers for all my domains so I can take advantage of this new feature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Discovery – My thoughts so far</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/discovery-my-thoughts-so-far/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/discovery-my-thoughts-so-far/</guid><description>&lt;p>I tried to resist but I am going to have to write about the new Star Trek series Discovery. Warning this post is going to include SPOILERS. If you read on you have been warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the first two episodes of the brand new Star Trek TV show. As I am an international viewer I used Netflix, if you are from the US you need to use CBS All Access. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DAD0hTKUAAAUkTP.jpg?resize=662%2C366&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have heard a lot of complaining that the show is not free to watch. CBS is making Star Trek Discovery to make money, if they don’t make money they will stop making it. Its as simple as that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix&lt;/a>
costs £5.99 per month and &lt;a href="https://www.cbs.com/all-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS All Access&lt;/a>
costs $5.99 per month. I don’t believe this is a lot of money. The 5.99 above allows you to watch any of the 726 Star Trek episodes at any time of day whenever you want as many times as you want, plus you have access to all the other movies or TV shows available. I don’t think this is too much to ask.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back to Discovery. I loved it! It felt like Star Trek. I had feared it might only share the name and would be an action filled TV show that had little in common with what he had seen before. I was wrong this is definitely a show that can proudly call itself Star Trek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Klingons&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it was first announced that the Klingons would feature in the new show I was a bit “meh”. We had done lots with the Klingons before and they had never been my favourite alien race. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-klingons-1002567-1280x0.jpg?resize=300%2C165&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The look of the Klingons was also going to be changed, I have to admit this didn’t bother me. Klingons have had their look updated before. In 1966 Klingons had dark faces and smooth foreheads, in 1979 the forehead ridges were added as the first Star Trek movie was made, and now Discovery has removed all hair from Klingons. I can explain it away as productional changes, I don’t need an on screen explanation like we had on Enterprise (or even DS9).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I have seen so far is a menacing alien race that fits with what we have seen before with lots of references to honor, Kahless and speaking Klingon. I must admit reading all the subtitles is getting a bit tiresome, but that is a minor issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conflict&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically Star Trek has not featured conflict between the main starfleet characters due to the idea that humanity has evolved beyond this. DS9 got round this by having Odo and Kira who are not starfleet characters so can have a little bit of conflict. Discovery has completely abandoned this idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the pilot episode, the Michael Burnham commits mutiny on her captain, even attacking her with a vulcan nerve pinch. In the third episode we finally meet the discovery crew. Gone are the TNG days where the ships crew are like a family, I am not sure I can think of a single character that would call another character “friend”. We are in a time of war so this would be expected, however I do hope we see deepening friendships form between characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am OK with the change to feature more conflict. I must admit the darkness of the third episode, did stop to make me think a bit, however by the fourth episode I was won over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cast&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story is concentrated around Michael Burnham, so I do worry that other characters won’t get a look in. However from what I have seen Michael Burnham is a great character. She is a strong female character, with a intriguing back story relating to Sarek and possibly also Spock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saru the alien character on the show, played by the very tall Doug Jones is great. From the trailers he was all about sensing death, but there is far more to him than that. I am looking forward to learn more about him and his threat ganglia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the show has gone on we have started to learn about the other characters like Captain Lorca, Tilly and Paul Stamets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Title Sequence&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t like the opening title sequence, it feels very cheap like a draft version which hasn’t been finished yet. I was looking forward to a title sequence that would show off the USS Discovery, maybe like TNG where it warps around our own solar system. What we see is some of the tech that features in Star Trek which is nice but I want more. The theme tune while great that it features parts from the classic theme doesn’t stand on its own. I can hum all the other TV shows themes, and now after 4 episodes would struggle to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However I expect that after a while I will grow to like this more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overall&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like Discovery and I will keep watching it. I want to find out what happens to the characters. There are no annoying characters like other shows have had. There is character development, none of the characters are going to finish where they started. I want more friendship between characters, but I expect that will come, I want more exploring and doing Star Trek stuff, but most of all I want more episodes, roll on next weeks show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other things I noticed&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sound effects on the bridge are awesome, it makes me feel at home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The USS Discovery doesn’t feature in the first two episodes despite being the title of the show.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Others have noted that Captain Georgiou has books on her shelf which feature classic episode titles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Star Trek is back with Discovery</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/star-trek-is-back-with-discovery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/star-trek-is-back-with-discovery/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/star-trek-is-back-in-2017">November 2015&lt;/a>
it was announced that a new Star Trek series was going to be launched. It has been a long wait with multiple delays but Star Trek Discovery is finally here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Star Trek Discovery launches in the US on 24th September and in the UK on 25th September.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoV3kc05Nwc?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>Lets have a look back how we got here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry in the 1960s. He imagined a show where we would explore the galaxy while also exploring the human condition. He described it as a wagon train to the stars. However it was cancelled after 79 episodes and three seasons due to budget cuts and low viewers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After cancellation its popularity boomed in reruns. In the mid 1970s an animated series was created. But demand for Star Trek continued until a new Star Trek show was commissioned called Phase Two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1977 Star Wars came out, and the phase two idea was cancelled and turned into a movie. In 1979 we got Star Trek The Motion Picture. It went massively over budget and failed to really capture the Star Trek spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A much cheaper sequel was created in 1982 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan with Roddenberry taking more of a back seat. A film widely considered to be one of the best trek films. Four more feature films starring the original cast were made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However in 1987 Gene Roddenberry teamed up with Rick Berman and The Next Generation was created with a brand new cast. The series ran for seven seasons set roughly a century after the adventures of Kirk and Spock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Popularity of Star Trek soured and this led Rick Berman to help create the spin off series Deep Space 9, Voyager and lastly Enterprise along with four feature films continuing the adventures of the TNG cast. When Enterprise was cancelled in 2005, Star Trek appeared to be dead after 18 years on TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However in 2009 movie creator JJ Abrams recast the classic crew for the big screen. The film was big on action, but took place in an alternative timeline allowing for familiar characters to have new adventures without interfering with events depicted in the TV shows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two sequels to this film have been produced and are bringing Star Trek back into popularity. This has given rise to Discovery. Star Trek is returning to the TV screen and it is going to be great.&lt;/p>

There is a video series hosted by Scott Hanselman called &lt;a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Fridays&lt;/a>
which I have started to watch in an effort to keep more up to date about some of its cool features.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I watched this video recently and it is all about application insights and new ways you can debug your web applications by creating snapshots. I am a big fan of application insights so adding extra ways to debug my apps is a big win for me. Once I get this feature working in my code I will no doubt blog about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure Functions</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-functions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/azure-functions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently blogged about using &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff">Azure Web Jobs&lt;/a>
, Azure Function is another way of doing the same thing, lets look at how they work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Sorry its been a while since I blogged but I suspect an erratic schedule will continue for the next few months.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create an Azure Function go to the Azure portal and click add new and search for &amp;ldquo;Function App&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give your app a name and select the usual resource group and location settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now when you open Function Apps you should see your new app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want my Function App to run on a schedule so I clicked the + next to functions and selected TimerTrigger. I am a c# programmer so I selected this option as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give your function a name and specify using the usual cron notation how often it should run. I want mine to run at 9.30pm each night so use 0 30 21 * * *&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now comes the code bit. By default you get a window with the following code in it&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">$&amp;#34;C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It is entirely up to you what you get your function to do. In my case I just wanted to call a URL on a schedule so I created some code that used httpclient.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> System.Net.Http;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">static&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">$&amp;#34;Buffer 0 function executed at: {DateTime.Now}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> HttpClient client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> HttpClient();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> result = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> client.GetAsync(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;URL&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> resultContent = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">await&lt;/span> result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> log.Info(resultContent);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once you have created your app and it has run you can use the monitor section to view success and failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is loads more you can do with Azure Function but this is a good place to start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pwned Pass – Available from the Play Store</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/pwned-pass-available-from-the-play-store/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/pwned-pass-available-from-the-play-store/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pwned Pass is now available from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Pwned Pass" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170813-205152.png?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pwned Pass is a simple android app that allows you to type in a password and tells you if it has been used in a data breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt of &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Have I Been Pwned?&lt;/a>
recently added a new API to his website which allows you to search his extensive database of pwned passwords, 306 million of them. I have simply created a Android frontend to this API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The API itself takes a SHA1 hash of the password and either returns a HTTP 200 if the password is found or a HTTP 404 if the password does not exist in the HIBP database. For more details of how Troy Hunt created this check out his &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My app simply generates a SHA1 hash of anything that is typed in and then passes this to Troy Hunt’s API. I then get the HTTP return code so I know if the password exists or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be noted that: &lt;strong>Do not send any password you actively use to a third-party service – even this one!&lt;/strong> I don’t log anything that you type into my app and all I am then doing is passing a SHA1 hash over SSL to HIBP. However you shouldn’t trust my word alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app itself is written in Visual Studio with Xamarin Forms in a similar fashion to the app I talked about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre">last week&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I am using Xamarin Forms there is the potential that I may develop iPhone or UWP versions of this code in the future. With that in mind I have made use of interfaces for the android specific parts of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also make use of the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/modernhttpclient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modernhttpclient&lt;/a>
nuget package due to problems I encountered with httpclient and SSL. This is due to limitations of what libraries are available in mono and what has been implemented, I suspect there are better ways to solve this but that is all part of the fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please do have a look at Pwned Pass and let me know what you think. Especially if it doesn’t work or throws errors. I would like to spend time making this app as good as I can make it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Android App Development and the Visual Studio Mobile Centre</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/android-app-development-and-the-visual-studio-mobile-centre/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past week or so I have been playing around with Xamarin and creating an android app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well I now have an app in the Google Play Store. Check out &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6148298088834956775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6148298088834956775&lt;/a>
. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170806-190053.png?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you rush and download the app I must warn you that it doesn’t do much yet. It displays some content that is on my website and there are a few links to allow sharing of content. I have some ideas to display content from my blog and allow sharing. I also have some other ideas for apps that might actually be useful to people that are not me. If you have ideas or feature requests do let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok how did I go about creating this app and getting it in the app store?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xamarin is now part of Visual Studio so step one is install all the Xamarin features to Visual Studio and build an app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I wanted to monitor my app. Now I know Application Insights doesn’t support apps so what tools are out there? HockeyApp is something I had heard of but they are in the process of being replaced with &lt;a href="https://appcenter.ms/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Mobile Centre&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was relatively easy to hook up my app to Visual Studio Mobile Centre. First install the required nuget packages. Then add using statements and the following line to your MainActivity.cs file (these instructions are available on the Mobile Centre)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Analytics;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Crashes;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Distribute;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Push;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>MobileCenter.Start(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;[Unique ID]&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Analytics), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Crashes), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Distribute), &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">typeof&lt;/span>(Push));
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now you can connect the Mobile Centre to your source code (VSTS in my case) and get it to run a build for every commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One complexity of the build is that you need to supply a keystore file (basically a certificate to digitally sign your app). I found the best way to do this was to use Visual Studio to create the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In VS2017 there is a option called Archive Manager under the tools menu. In here click the distribute button and select Ad-hoc. In the signing identity section you can create a keystore file. Enter a few details and a keystore file will be created in AppData\Local\Xamarin\Mono for Android\Keystore[keystore name][keystore name.keystore]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have added the keystore file to your build you can enable the distribute option. Now you will get an email after every build with a link to install your app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time your app crashes the details will be logged in the crashes section for you to explore and fix the issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Analytics section allows you to explore how your app is being used. You can also add Analytics.TrackEvent(&amp;ldquo;Feature X&amp;rdquo;) to measure the usage of different features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are more things you can do which I will explore more at another time along with how to get your app into the Google Play Store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Async and Await</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/async-and-await/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/async-and-await/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while the Async and Await commands in c# have confused me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like most things the best way to learn about something is to use it in a real world example. I am currently adding an email alert feature to a website. This is an ideal example of something that would benefit from Asynchronous programming. There is no need for the webpage to wait to send 1000s of emails, lets just send a call to get started and allow the browser to carry on as normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my first try at using async and await so feel free to suggest best practises in the comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start with a Send method in my EmailController.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> ActionResult Send(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> id, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> pageId, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> userID)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (!Authorize.checkPageIsAuthorised(userID, (Authorize.PageIds)pageId))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Redirect(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;/login&amp;#34;&lt;/span>);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Task&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>&amp;gt; t = SendNotifications(id,userID);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> Redirect(Request.UrlReferrer.ToString());
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This simply checks to see if you have permission to the page. If not redirects to the login page otherwise it makes a method call and redirects back to the page it came from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets have a look at that method call in more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Task&lt;string> t = SendNotification(id, userid);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SendNotification doesn’t return a normal string it returns a Task&lt;string>, so lets look at how we are creating this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span>&amp;gt; SendNotifications(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> id,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> type,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> userid)

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The return type is set to Task but it has the aysnc keyword appended to it. It also makes a call with the await keyword.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">async&lt;/span> Task SendEmail(EmailModel model,&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> emailHtmlBody)

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So that is it. My first bit of code that uses Async and Await. My controller calls a method asynchronously which then calls another method asynchronously which sends emails asynchronously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Async – This enables the Await keyword to be used in the method&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Await – This is where things get asynchronous. The await keyword allows the code to wait asynchronously for the long running code to complete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How good is your SSL?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/how-good-is-your-ssl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/how-good-is-your-ssl/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Troy Hunt SSL expert" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Troy-Hunt-Profile-Photo.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

&lt;p>I recently watched Troy Hunt’s &lt;a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/https-every-developer-must-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Every Developer Must Know about HTTPS&lt;/a>
course on Pluralsight. Its very good and really make you think about SSL certificates and how to correctly implement them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing in particular Troy mentions is the website &lt;a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSL Labs&lt;/a>
. This website allows you to test a websites implementation of SSL. A grade of A to F is assigned with A being the best and F being the worst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt has a &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/do-you-really-want-bank-grade-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog&lt;/a>
post where he discusses how Australian Banks score. Lets look at a few UK banks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>On the whole the ratings are all quite good with all being in the range A-C. However I have also indicated if they have SSL on the home page. Only 4 out 10 website listed above have the home page load under SSL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does this matter as long as the login is under SSL? Any page that loads over http is potentially at risk from a man in the middle attack. A fake malicious home page could contain links to any page and trick users into entering personal information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to test a bank or other website not listed here. Go to &lt;a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html&lt;/a>
and type the address that is on the SSL certificate in to the search. The good news is that this site scores a A.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy mentions that there is rapid growth in the adoption of SSL, there is also rapid growth in improving ratings. One of these banks went from a C to an A during the course of writing this blog.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing your first test</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/writing-your-first-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/writing-your-first-test/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whenever I write a new test I have to think how best to do it. Hopefully I can summarise a few tips here to help get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="arrange-act-assert">Arrange Act Assert&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#arrange-act-assert">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first thing I think about when writing a test is Arrange, Act, Assert. Arrange, Act, Assert is a pattern for writing the tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arrange&lt;/strong> – This gets things in order ready to execute the test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Act&lt;/strong> – This executes the method you want to test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Assert&lt;/strong> – This compares the value produced in the Act step with a known value typically with a method similar to the following&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assert.AreEqual(expected value, actual value)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Say for example you wanted to test a method called ReturnsTrue() which does nothing but returns a value of true. This method is in a class called ReturnsTrueClass&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Arrange step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>ReturnsTrueClass t = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> ReturnsTrueClass();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The Act step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> result = t.ReturnTrue();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The Assert step in this example would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Assert.AreEqual(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>, result);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is a stupidly simple example but hopefully you get the idea of how you can build all your tests with these three steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I saw a tweet complaining that someone has mixed up expected and actual in the Assert statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a minor but special hell reserved for those who mix up the expected and actual parameters in Assert.Equals&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Keith Williams (@zogface) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zogface/status/882737770095149056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2017&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>At first glance this probably isn’t the worst mistake to make as if your tests are all passing actual and expected are the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However tests will fail, that is the whole point of them, you can then fix bits of code. If you have mixed up actual and expected it adds extra time to debugging and figuring out what values are produced from your code and what you are expecting it to produce. It may be your test uses a mocking framework and somewhere in there, there is an issue, with mixed up expected/actual you may assume a problem in your code rather than the test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, how do you make such an error? When I type Assert.AreEquals() in Visual Studio, Visual Studio tells me what each parameter does, it takes a matter of seconds to do this, just by hovering over the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last tip to say about tests. Write your tests to test the behaviour of your application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uploading Files to AWS</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/uploading-files-to-aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/uploading-files-to-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a fan of Azure but today I have been looking at AWS. Specifically how to upload and download files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS S3 stores files in Buckets. I already had an AWS S3 account setup with a Bucket. I am going to assume you have got a bucket setup and concentrate on the code to get files in and out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First step is to use nuget to install the AWS packages. In nuget the packages you want are called AWSSDK.Core and AWSSDK.S3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The using statements you want to use are called Amazon.S3 and Amazon.S3.Transfer, not sure why this doesn’t match nuget, this difference caught me out a couple of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to the code that uploads files&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> InputStream = streamWriter,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = fileName
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Lets break it down and look at what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>AmazonS3Client AWSclient = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of AmazonS3Client, we are passing the Access Key and Secret Access Key both of which can be found from your Amazon S3 account My Security Credentials section. Amazon.RegionEndpoint.EUWest1 specifies the amazon data centres that your bucket is located in.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtility fileTransferUtility = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtility(AWSclient);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates an instance of TransfterUtility using the AmazonS3Client instance we created in the previous step.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (FileStream streamWriter = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> FileStream(path, FileMode.Open))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This opens up a filestream from a files path and specifies that the file should be opened.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>TransferUtilityUploadRequest fileTransferUtilityRequest = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> TransferUtilityUploadRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;flawlessimages&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> InputStream = streamWriter,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = fileName
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>};
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>fileTransferUtility.Upload(fileTransferUtilityRequest);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This last step specifies which bucket to upload to, what input stream to upload and the Key to use. Key is just AWS way of referring to files, more commonly referred to as the filename.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all you need to do to upload a file to your Bucket. The file will be located at &lt;a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[bucketname]/[filename]&lt;/a>
, however by default it will not be downloadable until you set Read permission to everyone, once you do that anyone who has the link will be able to download your file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the same permission level as any file you have on your webserver, however AWS has a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (s3Client = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> AmazonS3Client(accessKeyID, secretAccessKeyID, Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USEast1))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> GetPreSignedUrlRequest request1 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> GetPreSignedUrlRequest
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> BucketName = bucketName,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Key = filename,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Expires = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">5&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> };
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> urlString = s3Client.GetPreSignedURL(request1);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here we are generating a url to download the file, but we are specifying that it is only valid for 5 minutes. This means that if you share the url it will only work for 5 minutes, after that AWS will give an access denied message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is much better security than you have on a typical web server, and easy to implement, every time a user clicks on a download link you generate a new presigned url and send the download to the browser, as long as this process doesn’t take longer than 5 minutes the user will never know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Azure WebJobs to Automate Stuff</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/using-azure-webjobs-to-automate-stuff/</guid><description>&lt;p>I keep hearing about Azure WebJobs but I have never used them. Time to change this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that can run a script at a specific time. In my case I would like to hit a specific url of my website at the same time every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="WebJobs" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/addkeepalivewebjob.png?resize=313%2C615&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
To the right you can see an example of the WebJobs form on the Azure portal that you need to fill in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to supply a name for your webjob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to upload the script that will run in my case I used a powershell script. My script consisted of which basically just loads the url specified.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$progressPreference = &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;silentlyContinue&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri (&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;https://www.google.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>) -Method Get -UseBasicParsing;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Type refers to if your job will be triggered or run continuously, I want it to be triggered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Triggers refers to if you want it to be scheduled or manual, something that you can run on an ad hoc basis. I of course want scheduled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are familiar with the linux CRON then the next box will make sense to you for everyone else I will try and make sense of it. The box consists of 6 numbers which can either have a value or a *. The numbers correspond to the following {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hourly job would be expressed as 0 0 * * * *, ie every day of week, every month, every day, every hour and only when minute and second equals zero. For more help with this check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs#CreateScheduledCRON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSDN docs&lt;/a>
about it. I want to use 0 30 21 * * * to run daily at 9.30pm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s it everything setup, now time to wait and see if it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Oh no!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It failed to run at the specified time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason for this is the scheduler requires the feature Always On to be turned on which is not available in the free App Service. Before you reach for your wallets, I found a solution on this &lt;a href="https://tomssl.com/2016/12/20/how-to-get-azure-webjobs-to-run-indefinitely-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
that allows them to run on the free tier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thinking behind this solution is you need to keep the website alive throughout the day so Tom has created a script that does this. His script can be found on his blog or on his &lt;a href="https://github.com/TomChantler/Self-KeepAlive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github page&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set this script up to run every 5 minutes (0 */5 * * * *) like the example above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nextthing you need to do is create a Custom connection string in the Application Settings blade called SecretThing. Tom’s script references this to access the website and keep it alive. The password you need to put in SecretThing can be found in you publish profile (downloaded from the Overview blade in the Azure portal). For more details and a better explanation check out &lt;a href="https://tomssl.com/2016/12/20/how-to-get-azure-webjobs-to-run-indefinitely-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom’s blog&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last thing to mention about WebJobs is that you can see details about when they have run at https://[YourWebAppName].scm.azurewebsites.net/azurejobs/#/jobs and this can be a great place to help debug your scripts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fiddler and APIs</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/fiddler-and-apis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/fiddler-and-apis/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while ago I blogged about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2017/04/17/automation-promotion/">promoting&lt;/a>

but lets look at some improvements I can make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The BufferAPI package worked great from my console app, but when I tried to use it from a Controller in an MVC app I never got it to work. Lets look at the API docs and see if I can rewrite it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two main types of API calls GET which gets data from the server and POST which posts data to the server. These come from the types of HTTP requests.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I quickly figured out how to use the GET API call to authenticate using &lt;a href="https://api.bufferapp.com/1/profiles.json?access_token=XXXX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.bufferapp.com/1/profiles.json?access_token=XXXX&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However POST was defeating me. That was until I remembered &lt;a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiddler&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had heard Troy Hunt (and others) talk of using Fiddler to examine what data is being passed among websites. Troy uses it to do a man in the middle test to see what information can be stolen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is really easy to setup, install Fiddler, click yes to a few security warnings and you can see what information is being passed from your code to remote APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I had Fiddler installed I could compare what information is being passed between a successful API call using the BufferAPI nuget package and an unsuccessful API call using my code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fiddler also showed that passing my authentication token in a POST request is much better. Despite both GET and POST being encrypted when using HTTPS, anything at either end that logs URLs will have a log of your username and password.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have not tried Fiddler, give it a try especially if you are doing things with API calls.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How do I add Power BI data to a webpage?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/how-do-i-add-power-bi-data-to-a-webpage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/how-do-i-add-power-bi-data-to-a-webpage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I talked about &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2017/06/05/businessintelligence/">Power BI&lt;/a>
, what it is and some of the different services you can use with it. This week lets add some of that data to a simple web page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this example I am going to add the google analytics data from this website to this page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First login to your Power BI &lt;a href="https://app.powerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://app.powerbi.com/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click the get data link at the bottom left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click My Organisation to bring up the app search box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46c1lyxy053xcq66fowf.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click the Apps tab and search for “google” in the search box, you should then see Google Analytics, click into this and then click the get it now button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Log into your google account. If you have multiple google accounts I found it worked best to sign out of all of them or run this in an incognito window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are signed in you should see a list of the different google analytics data you have, select the one you want to use and click import.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Power BI will then go away and start loading the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once loaded go to Reports and select the Google Analytics that has been loaded. If you have more than one, it is a good idea to rename each one eg Corporate Site Google Analytics, Blog Google Analytics so you won’t get mixed up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the file menu select Publish to web and agree that you are OK for this to be made public.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will then be given a piece of HTML code that starts with &amp;lt;iframe copy this onto your web page. Reload your webpage and you should see something similar to mine below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be noted that while you can but the webpage containing the iframe behind a login page, the data could still be accessed if you knew the url contained within the iframe, this is why the link can be emailed and continue to work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Office Move</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/office-move/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/office-move/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="New Rack" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/20170422_191127-e1493403982560-169x300.jpg?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

For the past few weeks my software developing has been taking a back seat as I planned and coordinated the IT requirements of an office move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company I work for has been working out of a converted barn, but as the company has grown we have outgrown the building and for quite a while it has been a real squeeze to get everyone in. We now have a shiny new offices with plenty of room for growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was at the start of the year when I first started getting involved with the new office. At that time building work was about to begin. The office had concrete floors so in order to get network and power points in the floor, channels would have to be cut into the concrete for the floor boxes and cable runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the old office our servers were in a cabinet in the corner of the room which meant they could be quite loud especially when the fans were going full pelt. Our American owners were supplying brand new IT equipment and we would have a dedicated server room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon a weekly conference call was setup so we could coordinate with the IT people in America and the various different contractors that would help deliver our new office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I was particularly proud of was YDS. York Data Services (YDS) is an ISP I have worked with in the past at a previous job and I was able to continue my relationship with them and they were contacted and became our primary internet supplier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately most ISPs have to deal with BTOpenreach who have a bit of a monopoly on getting phone lines or leased lines installed. The initial estimate we were given was two weeks after we were due to move in. It was looking like we would move in and two weeks later we would get an internet connection. We were in the process of getting quotes for a temporary internet connection when BT contacted us and could get us connected up. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="New Office" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18121045_1302238519862436_8711390769620542649_o.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon afterwards a huge cabinet and two pallets full of equipment was delivered. Two days later a team was dispatched to rack everything up. On the rack we had the following equipment: 4 x UPS, 4 x Network Switches, 2 x Routers (for 2 x Leased Lines from different providers, the secondary connection has not been installed yet), 2 x Palo Alto Firewall devices, 2 x New Servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just prior to our move we had a rack full of equipment but no patch cables, nothing connected up and I was beginning to get concerned that we would not be ready in time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully a team was dispatched to help out over the weekend of the move, with the patch cables being delivered only hours beforehand. I worked closely with them and we worked late into the night. By the end of the Friday night our domain controller had been moved and its IP address updated. DHCP scopes had been setup for the new network. Once that was done we could get the WiFi points connected up (These had already been fitted to the ceiling).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following day we moved our existing servers and updated their IP addresses and got everything patched up. Furniture started arriving so desks could start being setup and phones connected up. Everything was slotting into place, and for the first time our new office was starting to look like an office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time it got to Monday the only problem was the phone number had not transferred as requested (something else to blame on BT) All staff could either connect via an Ethernet cable or connect to our brand new WiFi network and had access to all the IT services they had at the old office. Another minor issue was the NAS we used for backups had to be reset as it couldn’t communicate with the domain so no one could login, luckily this didn’t affect the data on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From my perspective the move was a massive success considering how complex and how many different people had been involved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interfaces</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/interfaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am trying to understand interfaces and when to use them in my code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interface defines a contract and any class that implements that interface agrees to fulfil that contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at an example as this tends to be how I learn best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most applications require some sort of data to work from so lets start by defining IData which can load data.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">interface&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">IData&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>My interface defines one method LoadData and outputs an object called Blog (I will explain why in a minute)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common data source is a SQL database so we could define a SQL class that implements IData.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">SQL&lt;/span> : IData
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog blog = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Blog();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">using&lt;/span> (SqlConnection con = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> SqlConnection(Connectionstring))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> con.Open();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We could also get data from an RSS feed of a blog (hence why I called the object Blog earlier)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">XML&lt;/span> : IData
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> XmlDocument myXmlDocument = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> XmlDocument();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> myXmlDocument.Load(Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> Blog blog = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">new&lt;/span> Blog();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach&lt;/span> (XmlNode RootNode &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">in&lt;/span> myXmlDocument.ChildNodes)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">//etc&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Both classes implement IData and have a method called LoadData which has a string parameter and outputs a blog object. The string parameter is either a connection string to a SQL database or the URL of the rss feed. Not sure if there is a better way of doing this bit, maybe the name of the string needs making more generic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have some classes that implement an interface what can we do with them. Lets write a class called GetData which gets data but doesn’t care if it comes form the rss feed or a SQL database.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">GetData&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">private&lt;/span> IData &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> GetData(IData repo)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo = repo;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">public&lt;/span> Blog LoadData(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">string&lt;/span> Connectionstring)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">var&lt;/span> original = &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">_&lt;/span>repo.LoadData(Connectionstring);
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> original;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When we call GetData we can either pass in XML or SQL as the class is not tied to either implementation. We could even write other classes that implement IData for testing purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My full code can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/InterfaceExample" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantages of writing code in this way include code that is easier to extend, easier to test and easier to maintain. This is only the start of my understanding and I am sure this is going to be a topic I come back to in the next few weeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning R</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/learning-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2017/learning-r/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="R" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Exchange-Rate-Calculator.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
Today I spent some time learning the R language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem I was trying to solve was to convert local prices of some items into Euros. I had been using a fixed exchange rate for all data, but as exchange rates fluctuate so much this is incorrect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first though was to find a free API that I could query to get the values I wanted. The first API I found didn’t cover all the currencies, the next one I found I burnt through the free allowance in one pass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A colleague of mine mentioned using R to solve this, he sent me some links and I set out to write my first piece of R code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My finished code can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/ExchangeRate/blob/master/script.R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
and I will attempt to explain some of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R defines functions fairly simply&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>nameoffunction &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">function&lt;/span>(arg1, arg2)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>arg1 &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> arg2
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have created a function that takes 2 parameters date and currency. I know I have about 10 different currencies that I want to get currencies for and I want to loop through each day so I will need to pass in a date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The source of my exchange rate information is the &lt;a href="https://www.xe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.xe.com&lt;/a>
website, its historical exchange rate page passes currency and date into the query string so I should be able to build up a string containing all the different elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All programming language can concatenate strings and R is no different. R uses paste()&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>However R has an annoying feature in this function. I would expect that var in the above example would contain &amp;ldquo;HelloWorld&amp;rdquo;, it doesn’t it contains &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;. Why it automatically adds a space I don’t know?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-r" data-lang="r">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>var &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">paste&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;World&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, sep&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I am not entirely sure what all of the code does but I can take a good guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>read_html() I would guess loads a html page, html_nodes() finds all the html tags of a certain type on the page, in my case &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;, html_table() reads the first table it finds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>table1[2] selects the second column, and head() selects a specific number of rows. I want the first row and second column so I combine these two as head(table1[2],1)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have found my exchange rate what do I do with it? R can read and write to SQL Server so why not store this info in a SQL lookup table. I can then use this data in a stored procedure when I process my data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To query sql you can use sqlQuery(), it has two parameters, a sql connection and a TSQL command (eg a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE statement)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use a while loop to loop through every day between 1st October 2016 and today and look up the exchange rate for each currency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now I am manually running this R script, however there are ways to run R directly from SQL Server which I may well investigate. I could then have a SQL job to run this on a schedule, maybe once a day to get the latest exchange rates. I also would like to do something a bit cleverer like only getting exchange rates for the days that I need them by querying existing database tables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon Web Services</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2016/amazon-web-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a big fan of Azure but I know zero about its biggest rival – Amazon Web Services or AWS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So lets sign up for a free trial and see what it can do. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Amazon Web Services" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aws-300x169.png?resize=300%2C169" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AWS free trial is available from &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/free/&lt;/a>
and lasts for 12 months. From memory I think the Azure free trial lasted only one month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start you need to login with your amazon account and create an AWS account. This requires your name and address and your payment info (you will only get billed if use services not covered by your free trial).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly AWS requires you to verify your identity via an automated phone call. (I don’t recall doing anything like this for Azure but please correct me if I am wrong.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are logged in you get a series of links displaying all the different services that are available. First impression is this is a simpler view to Azure’s portal with a similar amount of services. At the top right is an option to select which region you want to use, in Azure I use North Europe and West Europe, AWS has Ireland and Frankfurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-web-app">Create a Web App&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#create-a-web-app">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First thing to try is setting up a website. I selected create a web app and I get a page asking me for its basic details (very similar to Azure, however AWS asked what language your code is written in, Azure handles all of these) AWS websites appear to support a host of different options similar to Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The actual creation of your website takes a few moments (like on Azure). However the default URL for websites is similar to &lt;a href="http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/&lt;/a>
which is not quite as nice as the Azure equivalent &lt;a href="http://test.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.azurewebsites.net&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure has a host of command lines available via powershell. AWS has a similar command line interface called AWS CLI, including the option to deploy from git to your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is an extension that allows for the publishing of websites to AWS. (Just like you can publish to Azure)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="100-posts-old-L-fwCF_f" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/100-posts-old-L-fwCF_f-300x247.jpeg?resize=300%2C247" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So what have I learned in the past 100 posts?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It is easier to write a blog before you become a parent. More recently I am increasingly finding it difficult to find the time to blog. It used to be that I could write on an evening, but now James is around I often prefer to play with him, or more often stop him crawling where he shouldn’t.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like my job. The inspiration for most of this site is my day job and as you can read, I do a wide variety of different things, but I have a lot more to learn as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finding your niche is hard. 100 posts in and I am still not sure what my niche is. I started out with the broad niche of IT and what I do, I then considered something about IT and fatherhood but I don’t think that topic is really me. My current thinking is maybe DevOps especially as my role these days fits squarely between Development and Operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Its time for a refresh. I have been meaning to change the theme of this site for some time and I feel after 100 posts now is as good as time as any. I want to emphasise my skills and what I am learning and increase the emphasis on DevOps, which I think will be my niche.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching visitor numbers is addictive. Every day I look at how many people have looked at my blog, but I have yet to see a pattern between what I write and how many reads I get. Is my writing getting better? I don’t know. Are more people reading? Probably not. Will I keep going? Yes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So what is next?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully a refreshed look in the next few months. Hopefully regular posts. If there is something you want to see on here drop me a message via any of the social media links or put a comment below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is my favourite post?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/05/30/user-groups-and-f/">User Groups and F#&lt;/a>
which proved very popular and got me to start going to user groups something I still enjoy today. I also like &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/02/25/coding-myself-into-a-corner/">Coding Myself Into A Corner&lt;/a>
which got me to start thinking more if I was giving myself future problems. But there are many others I like such as &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/09/03/baby-magic-and-becoming-a-father/">James and Becoming a father&lt;/a>

&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="SQL Server Management Studio" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sql-server-2012-management-studio-splash-screen.png?resize=529%2C360" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have enjoyed seeing the improvements that each new version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) introduced. One great improvement was intellisense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature saves typing and reduces errors by automatically suggesting tables, column names or other database objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common query that I get asked to write is provide a spreadsheet that gives the information that satisfies certain criteria. This is easy to do in SSMS, you can write the query, click execute and the rows that satisfy the criteria are displayed. These rows can then be easily copy/pasted into Excel or other spreadsheets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A common data item that gets stored in databases is addresses and addresses often contain line breaks to make the data display better. In the earlier versions of SSMS, when you copied and pasted these line breaks were ignored and the data displayed the same in SSMS as it did in Excel. However in the more recent version, theses line breaks got copied across breaking your spreadsheet and making it hard to see what data corresponded with what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I don’t know if this should be described as introducing a bug or fixing one. I can easily argue both sides. If your data contains a line break and you copy this data it should include the line break in the destination, but if it does that it displays badly in Excel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fix I have been using until recently is to use the following TSQL command in my queries.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">REPLACE&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">REPLACE&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#f92672">@&lt;/span>str, CHAR(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">13&lt;/span>), &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;), CHAR(10), &amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This command replaces any line breaks with an empty string. Both Char(10) and Char(13) are needed because you can have different types of line breaks. This is great if you are writing the script from scratch but isn’t great if your are running a stored procedure or your query has a lot of columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this is to use Visual Studio to run your SQL query. In Visual Studio you can write and run queries via Server Explorer and the results produced don’t contain line breaks. I have only just discovered this solution, but so far it has worked and is very easy to do, plus as I do most of my development in Visual Studio anyway it saves me having to open SSMS to test my queries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Trek is back (in 2017)</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/star-trek-is-back-in-2017/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/star-trek-is-back-in-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="3f448330857e4ca7ba40ab5465a3c2cb62cdb98c" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3f448330857e4ca7ba40ab5465a3c2cb62cdb98c.png?resize=620%2C260" loading="lazy"

&lt;p>Currently this office is connected via a wireless link with our head office. Unfortunately we have recently experienced some poor performance with this connection, this has now been corrected but like all technology there is the chance of it failing in some way in the future and causing loss of business because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="internet-connection">Internet Connection&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#internet-connection">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is one of my first considerations. I need a reliable internet connection and there are a lot of options to consider, lets look at a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14091d1357164106-internet-connection-drops-every-couple-minutes-cable-sxchu-internet1.jpg?resize=660%2C252&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ADSL Connection&lt;/strong> This is your standard internet connection that most homes have, you get around 20Mb/s download but only 2Mb/s upload for a fairly low price per month. Speeds are dependent on area and the quality and distance from your exchange, some rural areas have speeds much lower than this. As this connection is for an office I want the best connection I can afford so would rather not go down this option if I can avoid it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet)&lt;/strong> This is what ISPs typically mean when they say superfast broadband. The cables that have been laid to your exchange cabinet have been upgraded to fibre optic cables which are capable of much faster transfer speeds (eg 40Mb/s download and 10Mb/s upload). This is my ideal choice, however BT Openreach are responsible for upgrading the country to these cables and they are not very quick about it. A few years back when investigating this FTTC had almost reached our office, but when I investigated today nothing seems to have progressed. Both FTTC and ADSL require a phone line into the office to run on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Leased Line&lt;/strong> This is where your ISP connects a dedicated line to your office which provides you a much faster connection (upload and download speeds are the same) but this is very expensive. We have this for our head office as this is where our servers are located and the faster speed benefits the entire company. We do not want to do this for every branch office as it will be too expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spur from a Leased Line&lt;/strong> It could be possible to branch or spur off the leased line to our second office. This would be one leased line that terminates in two locations instead of one. However due to the distances involved I do not think this will be possible in my case and may end up costing as much as a second leased line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ISP&lt;/strong> As well as the type of connection I need to decide who will provide it. There are hundreds of ISPs out there but I like to use ISPs that have a good reputation or I have used in the past and have been happy with. I do not stick with one ISP for all my connections as I like to have some connections that continue to work should that ISP be experiencing problems. ISPs that I would recommend are YDS, Eclipse and PlusNet&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Money Off&lt;/strong> While I am talking about internet connections the government has been offering a scheme offering businesses money off upgrading their connections to a superfast connection (either FTTC or Leased Line) More information can be found on your councils website, If you have an office in York have a look here for more details. We got £3000 off installation so worth investigating if you qualify.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vpn-connection">VPN Connection&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#vpn-connection">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Offices require access to far more resources than just the internet. This particular office requires access to our email and database servers as a bare minimum. One way to access a remote offices network resources is through a VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection. So my next consideration is how to establish a VPN link between our offices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Software&lt;/strong> Windows Server includes RRAS (Routing and Remote Access Service) which you can use to configure a VPN connection. One important thing to note is that the server needs at least two network connections, one on the internet with a public IP and one on the internal network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hardware&lt;/strong> The more expensive routers often have settings that allow the configuration of a VPN connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have used both of these methods in the past. RRAS is a pain to work with but has evolved with the newer versions of windows server, so may not be as bad as I remember. Using a router to do VPN introduces its own set of problems and there is no guarantee of avoiding RRAS, you may still need it to authenticate the VPN provided by your router.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="multiple-connection-handling">Multiple Connection Handling&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#multiple-connection-handling">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Internet connectivity is being provided in two ways, the primary way is via a Wireless link and the second way is via one of the options above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of options to deal with multiple connections, do I want to load balance both connections and use them all the time, do I want to fail over onto the second connection only if the first one fails, or do I want it to be a manual process or switching over to the backup network if problems occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see there are lots of different technologies to consider before I can add resiliency to this office and I haven’t even started to think about if an additional server will be required.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unmanaged Database Deployment</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/unmanaged-database-deployment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/unmanaged-database-deployment/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past few months I have been deploying changes to my companies database every couple of weeks or so. Over a weekend when the database was not being used I would make a backup of the database, load up visual studio, deploy the database changes and copy a couple of front-end files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My weekends and evenings have recently become a bit more precious to me since the arrival of my son James. At suitable times to run the database upgrade I am either, asleep, about to fall asleep or be spending time with James.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This entire deployment can be set to run at a time of my choosing using SQL Server Jobs, (not sure why I never thought of doing this before). I still need to check everything is working after it has run. The job can send me an email if it encounters any problems so I can still ensure the company has the minimum of problems but has more frequent changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="unmanaged-database-deployment">Unmanaged Database Deployment&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#unmanaged-database-deployment">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OK so what do I need to do to set this up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/deploy.jpg?resize=263%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Test all your code changes are working correctly on a backup of the database and everything is committed to source control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Backup everything that is going to be changed so it can be rolled back in case of a problem. I don’t rely on the daily backup jobs for this, I do my own. Maybe I am a bit paranoid, or maybe I am just being cautious.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>BACKUP &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DATABASE&lt;/span> DBName &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">TO&lt;/span> DISK&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;E:\SQL Backups\Filename.bak&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I would include in the backup file name the date and time of the deployment for easy reference later on. For the front-end files these are backed up daily and only ever change during a deployment so I am going to rely on the day to day backups, plus they are in source control so in a worse case scenario I can look there.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>From Visual Studio create a deployment script using the publish option and save as a file on your database server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a SQL Server Job and give it a descriptive name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In steps create a step called backup and enter the T-SQL code above. Set this to stop on failure and continue on success.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a second step called upgrade of type operating system with the following code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>sqlcmd -S (local) -i &amp;#34;E:\SQL Backups\deploy_test.sql&amp;#34;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The -S parameter is the name of your SQL Server instance and the -i parameter is the path to the sql script you generated from Visual Studio above. Set this job to quit reporting success or failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>In schedule create a date time you want the job to run, make sure this is a one time job as you don’t want it to try and run again possibly causing problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In notifications I have set to email on completion, you can set it to email on failure only. I would prefer to know the outcome of the job regardless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using SQL Server jobs to copy files over the network is possible but is not trivial to setup so I am going to use windows task scheduler for this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a job in task scheduler to copy all the ADPs or ADEs that have been changed. If the SQL job fails you will need to copy the old versions of these back but that is simple enough to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This process can be expanded to check code out of source control and do even more automated deployments but for now this is good enough for my purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Baby Magic and Becoming a Father</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/baby-magic-and-becoming-a-father/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/baby-magic-and-becoming-a-father/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am pleased to announce the birth of James David Martin Foster weighing 9 lb 12 on 19th August 2015.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mother and Baby (and Father) are doing well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/james5.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not a baby person, I hate children and I run a mile from other people’s babies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But James performed some magic on me and now I will do anything for him. If you have had children you probably know what I am talking about and if you haven’t you are probably like me 24 hours before James arrived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the pregnancy I had been living in denial that I would become a father, despite the wife speaking about nothing else and our home filing with baby equipment. It was only minutes before I first saw my son that I changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to James’s large size, the birth wasn’t easy. After about an hour of pushing the midwife called in a team of doctors and nurses to help and I think it was at this point that it started to hit me. I am not an emotional man, if anything I tend to repress my feelings but I completely and utterly failed to do that on this occasion. By the time the baby had been placed on my wife’s chest tears of joy were streaming down my face and this continued for some time. Moments after birth James had a tight grip on my finger. His tiny hands were like miniature versions of my own hands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jameshand.jpg?resize=169%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been asked what it felt like holding James in my arms for the first time, this happened on the following day. I am not sure if I can put it into words, but a few adjectives come to mind, amazing, great, fantastic, humbling. James depends on me (and his mother) for everything and his existence has put a new spin on everything I do. I want to be there for him, help him learn stuff, provide for him and love him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been working very hard recently, spending my free time writing this blog, learning stuff and doing other work. The reasons for this hard work are now clear, I work so I can provide for James and so I can spend my free time with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before James arrived I had it in my head that his mother would do the majority of the caring for him. This is not going to happen now that I have met James. I want to cuddle him, change his nappies, dress him, hold his hand, take him to school, watch TV with him, stroke his head when he is ill, tell him about my life experiences, introduce him to wine, tell him about girls, help him move home, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not saying being a parent is going to be easy. I am pretty clueless about what is in store for us, but already I am worrying if he is OK, trying to calm him down when he is upset and being woken in the early hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway only time will tell if I continue being this positive about fatherhood, but so far I am loving it. Normal blog posts will hopefully resume over the next few weeks (or when I have time).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things to know before working on your database</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/things-to-know-before-working-on-your-databasethings-to-know-before-working-on-your-database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/things-to-know-before-working-on-your-databasethings-to-know-before-working-on-your-database/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently saw this blog &lt;a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/07/questions-to-ask-before-you-touch-a-database-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post&lt;/a>
by &lt;a href="http://www.brentozar.com/team/brent-ozar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Ozar&lt;/a>
that I thought I might discuss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brent listed 13 questions to ask about a database before you start working with it. I am going to go through these 13 questions and expand on them based on my experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is this database in production now?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I think it should go without saying that the first thing you should find out is if your database is in production. If its not in production you can do what you like and no one will notice.
I know what databases are in production and which aren’t where I work so I can answer this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If this goes down, what apps go down with it?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>What apps are running on what databases is a good second question. I have at least one database which has multiple front end apps. At first glance you would think that that these two apps are not connected but they are, I need to be careful with both of these apps to make sure they don’t break each other.
I know what apps run off what databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When those apps go down, is there potential for loss of life or money?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is a difficult question so I will split it into two. Loss of life, my databases don’t control life support machines or nuclear weapons so my first instinct would be to say no. However it is not that straightforward, what if your app allowed contractors to know the location of dangers inside a property they were working in. Once your app goes down, they could have an accident due to lack of information.
Loss of money, this one is more straightforward. Time is money in the business world so any time that your app is down and your employees are not able to work is a loss of money. If your database is linked to an eCommerce site, the loss of money could be extremely high.
I know what affect downtime will have on my users and business.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How sensitive are these apps to temporary slowdowns?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Similar to the previous question, a slowdown can be as serious as downtime for some applications.
Luckily most of my apps are internal only so are not seriously affected by slowness.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful backup?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I manage the backup schedule for all my databases so I know exactly when each one was last backed up. When ever I do anything to a production database I will run a backup so I can roll back in case of problems. As part of developing changes I run my changes on a backup of the data. I can script all my changes and repeatedly run them against a backup until I am sure no problems will occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/uf010206.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful restore test?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>More important than a backup is testing restoring your databases. If you can’t restore data then your backup is useless. I try to test restoring my backups at least weekly so I know that I can rely on my backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is everyone okay losing data back to the last successful backup?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If disaster strikes you could loose all data between now and the time of your last backup. But all is not lost transactional backups can be scheduled throughout the day, in my case the most data we could loose is 15 minutes. This could be configured to be more or less frequent depending on your data. But remember the previous question and make sure you test a restore of your transactional backups, if you can’t restore from them you will be forced to restore from the last successful backup.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="8">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When was the last successful clean corruption test?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Corruption can be a killer if it is not found quickly. If you need to restore to the last backup before corruption occurred this could result in a significant amount of data loss. To check for corruption you need to run DBCC regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="9">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do we have a development or staging environment where I can test my changes first?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If the answer to this is no, then your next job is to setup a development or staging area. Having a development environment makes development a lot easier and I don’t think I could manage to do all the changes I have done recently without one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="10">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is there any documentation for why the server was configured this way?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I really wish we had more documentation about configurations as it would make finding out why thing were setup the way they are. So unfortunately the answer to this question is No.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="11">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What changes am I not allowed to make?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Depending on what your app does, where it is hosted, how quick the changes are needed and many other factors will all restrict what changes you can make. Historical decisions on the database can also affect what changes can be made, if the database has been structured in a certain way, it may be very difficult to restructure it in a more efficient way.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="12">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who can test that my changes fixed the problem?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is an interesting question, from experience the best people to speak to about problems with the database are the users. If they can show you how to reproduce a problem, you should be able to fix this problem, after that you can probably get them to verify that it has been fixed.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="13">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who can test that the apps still work as designed, and that my changes didn’t have unintended side effects?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is an extension of the previous question. The main users of your app should be your first port of call to find out if the app works as expected. However exploring side affects and undesired features is something that I would test as part of the development process. It has taken a while but I have constructed a detailed check list that can be used for testing so I know that most bugs can be found before release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sudoku Challenge</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/sudoku-challenge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/sudoku-challenge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last night I went to a Code Dojo at Leeds Sharp (the coding user group I have started going to). A Code Dojo is a programming challenge that people work on usually in pairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The challenge that we worked on was to code a solution to the puzzle game Sudoku. The code we worked with can be found on github.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2000px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg_.png?resize=660%2C660&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know much about Sudoku but the game goes like this. You start with a 9×9 grid, and the idea is to fill in all the missing numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each Row can only use each digit 1 to 9 once, each column can only use each digit 1 to 9 once and each subgrid (3×3) can only use each digit once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I worked with Richard one of the Leeds Sharp organisers, we started by trying to loop through each empty cell and insert values in a brute force attack, but this approach didn’t get us very far (literally as the application crashed!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The approach that we needed to use was to loop through calculating possible values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was only when I sat down at this dojo did I realise how much I still have to learn, but while talking with Richard about different approaches and different coding structures I started to learn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaway SQL Log growth</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/runaway-sql-log-growth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/runaway-sql-log-growth/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today is my day off, but I wake up and have a quick look at &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/i-love-nagios/">nagios&lt;/a>
to see if there is anything I need to worry about. Yes there is, SQL Server has run out of disk space on its data disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I race downstairs and VPN onto the server to find out what has happened. One of my monitoring databases has had runaway log growth and is over 80Gb is size.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>BACKUP LOG [DBName] &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">WITH&lt;/span> TRUNCATE_ONLY
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>DBCC SHRINKFILE(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;DBName_Log&amp;#39;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Free disk space is back to normal, all users will be unaware of the problem and everything is fine again. I create a daily job that runs the above code, that way it should stay a manageable size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next I need to find out why it happened and to prevent it happening again in the future (Next time I have a day off I want to lie in!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I check the SQL logs and notice&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BACKUP LOG WITH TRUNCATE_ONLY or WITH NO_LOG is deprecated. The simple recovery model should be used to automatically truncate the transaction log.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I remember what I have done to cause this issue. I have a separate disk for my backup files and earlier in the week I noticed this disk was filling up, a large amount of space was taken up by transactional backup files. I thought I don’t need to backup the transactions for this non critical database, I will just do a full backup at the start of everyday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However what I forgot is that a transactional backup keeps the log file under control, once this backup was stopped the log file grew uncontrollably. The answer, change the database from FULL mode to SIMPLE.&lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="image002" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image002-300x270.png?resize=300%2C270" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my understanding of how backups work in FULL mode. A full backup is done at the start of the day which resets the log file, then changes in the database are stored in the log file, this is backed up into a transactional backup and the log file gets reset. If you have regular transactional backups throughout the day the log file doesn’t grow too much, however with no transactional backups your log file contains an entire days worth of changes and so for a monitoring database this could be quite large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In SIMPLE mode you can’t do transactional backups and the log doesn’t grow uncontrollably. This shouldn’t be used for production databases as if there is a problem you could loose data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Source Control Fail</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-control-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-control-fail/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every developer uses source control, it is a great tool for keeping track of changes to your code, seeing who has done what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However I keep messing up, my use of it. I am fairly disciplined when creating new features, all my changes will get committed to source control and when I am happy I will deploy these changes to the live system. But as soon as there is a bug, especially one where the client is chasing for a fix, I will deploy a fix as soon as humanly possible on to the live system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance there is nothing wrong with what I have described but what happens the next time I deploy a new feature. Yes the bug the client was complaining about gets deployed with the new feature as the fix was never committed into source control. The client gets angry as the bug he was screaming about is back again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every change you make to the system &lt;strong>MUST&lt;/strong> be committed to source control. If it isn’t that change will look like it never existed. I have worked with source control for over 5 years why do I keep making this rookie mistake over and over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt has a &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/05/10-commandments-of-good-source-control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post&lt;/a>
about the 10 commandments of using source control. His number two commandment is “If it’s not in source control, it doesn’t exist” He talks more about code you have written being not saved into source control, but the principal is the same for my example as his.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are ways to automatically deploy from source control, however most of the time you don’t want your live database being rebuilt because you fixed a typo. Additional steps will need to be implemented and there is still the chance that you might want to bypass these steps to fix the urgent problem. The only way past this problem is for you and everyone on your team to be disciplined and only ever commit to source control first, and only after that deploy live (either automatically or manually)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure Traffic Manager</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/azure-traffic-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/azure-traffic-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have spent most of the day tweaking my Azure websites. Lots of fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week unfortunately Azure had some problems and many websites that were running in the North Europe data centre were unavailable for several hours. And you guessed it my websites were hosted here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All hosting providers are going to have downtime from time to time and this is just something you have to take on the chin. The important thing to do in times like these is communicate with your customers about what is going on and that you are doing everything you can to restore service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However Azure has some amazing features that you can configure to help manage when downtime occurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure is Microsoft’s global cloud platform. And it really is global, there are data centres in North Europe, West Europe, Brazil, Japan, two more in Asia and five in the US. In the event of problems it is highly unlikely that more than one of these would go down at once. If all of these are unavailable, I expect the planet earth is facing some kind of cataclysmic event and the fact that my website is down is not a priority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IC750592.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="IC750592" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IC750592.jpg?resize=662%2C347" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/a>
To take advantage of these multiple data centres, Azure has something called a Traffic Manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traffic Manager has various settings but I am using it in failover mode. This means that if one website goes down, the next one is used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All you need to do is create a traffic manager, add two or more websites to it (called endpoints) and choose a page that needs to be monitored so Azure knows which websites are up and which are down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are using SSL or custom domain names, there are a few extra steps you need to do. Your custom domain name needs pointing at the traffic manager, not the individual websites. The websites themselves have three domain names, the traffic manager address, the azure address and the custom domain name. The SSL certificate can then be assigned to each website that you have added to the traffic manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was easy wasn’t it, and now if a website goes down traffic manager will use the next one. While testing this, the transition to the next website was almost immediate. I did notice that if you had a browser showing the website open during a problem you sometimes got an error page, I think this was probably due to browser caching, reopening a tab or browser fixed this issue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tidying my desktop</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/tidying-my-desktop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/tidying-my-desktop/</guid><description>&lt;p>My desktop is always a mess. I constantly download files there and forget all about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every now and then I copy files into sub directories, so my desktop looks sane for a day or two before it gets out of control again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don’t I write a script that I can schedule to do this for me. Then my desktop will always be tidy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have written a few simple batch scripts, but of course the best scripting language out there at the moment is PowerShell. Lets use that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows provides a nice little utility for writing scripts called the Windows PowerShell ISE, so let&amp;rsquo;s start by loading that up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS has lots of help included to help you, just run &lt;strong>Get-Help [name of ps command]&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To move files you can use &lt;strong>Move-Item&lt;/strong> which works very similar to copy, specify source and destination. In my case I moved files based on their file extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Move-Item *.pdf folder&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all I need to do is schedule this script to run either every day or so, or maybe every time I login or switch my computer on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PowerShell can do lots more interesting things which hopefully I will blog about soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Source Code for Game of Life</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-code-for-game-of-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 09:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/source-code-for-game-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I blogged about the Game of Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well it took some searching through dead hard drives and old USB storage but I found the program I wrote, and better than that I have figured out how to turn it back into source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The file date is November 2004 and the source code has no comments so I don’t know what was going through my head when I wrote it, or even what some of it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To view the source code download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.src_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life.src&lt;/a>
, to download the finished program download &lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Life.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life&lt;/a>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am actually surprised I was expected the code to be much worse than it was, I am not saying it is good, but I can see more than one method and I can’t see any code that obviously is repeated. I can see some terrible variable names. Note to future self don’t use tmp676_674!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming that I wrote this in 2004 what would I have been doing then? It was before I started working in IT. (Hard to imagine I know!) It may even have been before I started living with Keith, before he recruited me for my first IT role. I think I was probably working as an administrator for Defra at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we put 2004 in technical terms, it was before I joined facebook, Office 2003 and XP would have been installed on my PC, and probably felt brand new.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Choosing a Blog Theme</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/blog-theme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/blog-theme/</guid><description>&lt;p>You may have noticed that my blog has a new home. It can now be found on its own domain &lt;a href="http://www.funkysi1701.com">http://www.funkysi1701.com&lt;/a>
. This change not only gives me more flexibility to make any change I like, it also feels good to have a website again. If you had followed my blog, do keep following it at the new location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have also been playing about with giving the site a new look, hope you all like it. I have gone for a more image focussed front page. No doubt in a few weeks I will be bored and change the look again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have recently been reading about blogging and one suggestion is to have a clear theme, or idea of what the blog is about. I am not sure my blog has a clear theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started blogging I was more interested in blogging than thinking about what I was blogging about. The vague theme I worked off was to talk about what I do, to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;What do you do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this is a fairly good theme, but it could probably do with some refinement. The best themed blogs are specialist or about something specific. As I am generally learning about development, rather than doing development I think this should be part of what I concentrate my blogs about. A minority of my blogs can continue to be about the other things I spend my time doing, as it’s always good to have a break from the main “meat” of the blog every now and then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The people who read my blogs are split between technical people and non-technical people, so I would like to continue to explain what I do in non-technical terms. This is an essential skill for a developer (or SysAdmin) as you will always need to explain what you are doing, or discuss requirements. It is not an easy skill and like development itself, the more I do it the better at it I will become.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So watch this space for the blogs to come. I know I will be working with Azure over the next few weeks so maybe some blogs about that, maybe some more SQL blogs or maybe about what I learn next.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ten Forward Episode #135 – Anti Firbob is Back or Simon’s Desert Island Trek</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/ten-forward-episode-135-anti-firbob-is-back-or-simons-desert-island-trek/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/ten-forward-episode-135-anti-firbob-is-back-or-simons-desert-island-trek/</guid><description>&lt;p>The podcast I recorded the other week has been released, why not have a listen by heading over to &lt;a href="http://www.trekmate.org.uk/ten-forward-episode-135-anti-firbob-is-back-or-simons-desert-island-trek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trekmate.org.uk&lt;/a>

I didn’t get very far but one of the things I built was The Game of Life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately I can not find the code I wrote, probably a good things as it is probably amusingly bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you are probably asking what is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game of Life&lt;/a>
? The game of life, sometimes called cellular automation, is a simulation of cells being born and dying. It is sometimes called Conway’s Game of Life after the British mathematician who devised it in 1970.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/Gospers_glider_gun.gif" loading="lazy"
width="250" height="180"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The game has several rules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Any cell with less than three neighbours will die on the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any cell with three neighbours lives on to the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any cell with more than three neighbours will die on the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours will be born on the next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now I had not thought about this game until the other day when I came across a &lt;a href="https://chaosnil.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/new-project-conways-game-of-life-in-every-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog&lt;/a>
and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/chaomodus/gameoflife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github page&lt;/a>
which sparked my interest again. This version is written in javascript, but the blog mentions a desire to build this program in many different languages. I want to build this with visual studio in C# as it should provide a good training exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several problems I need to overcome to achieve this, I am currently trying to work out how to &amp;ldquo;draw&amp;rdquo; the cells. My current thinking is that maybe I can code it using characters to display the cells and then replace with pixels once I have the logic correct. Well lots for me to learn!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Great British Code Off</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/great-british-code-off/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/great-british-code-off/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Great British Code Off" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/logo.jpg" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Great British Bake Off and The Great British Sewing Bee are very popular TV shows. Each week the contestants take part in a baking or sewing challenge and the judges choose the best and the worst, with the worst having to leave. This is very entertaining as you watch the drama between the contestants and the reactions as the judges tell them they are rubbish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Could this simple format be applied to computer programming? I think it could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only developers I know argue about the best way of tackling different problems, despite being friends. I am going to assume that this is typical behaviour and not unique to them. So for this TV show, we will split the contestants into pairs, that way we would get the added drama of how well they work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still undecided if the pairs stick together each week with one pair leaving or if we randomize the pairs with one person leaves. The second option would cause there to be a group of three every other week, not sure if this would be a benefit or a curse for that group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friends who are experienced programmers have agreed to be the judges, they both have experience of hiring and firing people, know what to look for in good code, and never agree so should be entertaining enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the bake off the contestants don’t really know how well they have done until the judges cut into their cake and take a bite. For the code off we could not compile the code until the judges run it, would make coding extra difficult as if the contestants are anything like me, I run my code every five minutes to see what affect that change has made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what challenges can we come up with?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Web Design week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stored Procedure week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mobile App week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loops&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Logic problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bugs weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performance issues&lt;/li>

When my alarm goes off in the morning, I will snooze it for twenty minutes or so before getting out of bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bill-gates-quote.jpg" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my work my laziness continues. Remote Desktop (or RDP) is probably my number one laziness tool. For those that don’t know RDP allows you to connect to another computer and access it like you were sat in front of it. So I can be sat at my desk and RDP into any other computer in the office including any server. However this laziness tool does sometimes require a bit of effort sometimes, powering on the target computer, logging on locally, making sure the user account you are using is allowed to use RDP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing a script is another example of a laziness tool. I often get asked to do tedious and long-winded task, because I am lazy I will go out of my way to learn how to write a script to do this, so that I can run this script and do this long-winded task in a matter of seconds. There are loads of different types of scripts from database SQL scripts, to PowerShell scripts that can do almost anything on your server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PowerShell is something Microsoft are really pushing at the moment, you can even write scripts to create new user accounts, so no longer will you have to remember to tick that tickbox for every new user account. And because PowerShell is part of almost all MS technologies you can link Exchange to Active Directory and you don’t even have to remember the right syntax as PowerShell has a built-in help command to tell you how to run that useful command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I am now moving into a more developer role can I continue to be lazy? I sure can. Code should be written once and reused as often as possible and this is one of the features of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can be as simple as creating a master page so you don’t need to recreate the same code on every one of your webpages. Or every time you find yourself rewriting the same code again, you plug it into a method so it can be called again and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But of course the ultimate way to be lazy is of course get yourself some staff and spend all day getting them to do everything. If you are lucky they may even try and adopt some of these lazy ideas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Podcasts</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/podcasts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/podcasts/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while now I have been listening to podcasts. For those that don’t know a podcast is an audio file that you can download and listen to, usually about a topic you are interested in. The topics that interest me are obviously Star Trek, Science and Technology and IT stuff. I mainly listen to them in the car when I am driving, but sometimes it will be at home when doing jobs around the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the first podcast I listened to was &lt;a href="http://www.trekmate.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trekmate&lt;/a>
. Trekmate as the name suggests is about Star Trek, it’s a few guys talking about Star Trek. It’s very similar to those conversations you have in the pub with your mates. Trekmate do lots of podcasts, one for almost every flavour of Star Trek out there, I don’t keep up with all of them, but the ones I listen to I really enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favourite podcast that is work related is &lt;a href="http://www.runasradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RunAs Radio&lt;/a>
. If you are a SysAdmin or have an interest in servers or IT you should listen to this. The host Richard Campbell interviews IT experts about a particular piece of technology, one week it will be Exchange, the next Security, and then SQL Server. Often I will learn something that I will want to try out, some weeks I won’t learn something specific but will give be an insight into which way IT for businesses is going. I think it was probably only after listening to RunAs Radio that are started having more of a long term plan for my IT infrastructure at work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I have blogged about before I am learning Development so obviously I listen to &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET Rocks&lt;/a>
. This is hosted by Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell (yes the same guy that does RunAs Radio) who talk to developers about code, learning and IT from a more Developer point of view. This is released 3 times a week so is a bit hit and miss sometimes, but most weeks there will be something relevant to me or worth listening to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago I did something for the first time, I was a guest on one of the Trekmate pods, TenForward. I reviewed 5 Star Trek episodes. This was a bit of a leap for me as an introvert I don’t like to be the center of attention and I certainly don’t like how my voice sounds recorded. Hopefully when released people will like it and I will do lots more of these in the future. Once it has been released I will put a link up here so you can all have a listen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pair Programming</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/pair-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/pair-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I have been working through the challenges on the &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freecodecamp&lt;/a>
website and one of the unique things that this site does is give you the chance to program with another person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am an introvert and if you were to ask me to pick up the phone and ring someone I will procrastinate a lot before doing it (if I do it at all), I also am not good at speaking with strangers but I have been enjoying the pair programming I have done so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have only pair programmed a couple of times so far, so I am no expert. The first time was with someone from North America, it was weird to begin with talking to your computer and hearing an american voice respond, but you soon forget that as you concentrate on the problems you are working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second time was with someone from the Netherlands. This time we tackled some trickier problems. Both times I took more of a back seat but I think contributed useful stuff and I certainly learnt a lot from the other person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that is the key thing about pair programming, you learn so much about how to look at a problem from another angle, or learn about a function you haven’t heard of before. If you are reading this and it was you that I pair programmed with a big thank you for spending the time with me, I learnt a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was trying to pair program again tonight but technical problems prevented me. One problem I have found is finding a partner, was hoping to do some yesterday but no one else was around to partner with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would be interested to learn what companies use pair programming. I imagine a pointy haired boss would say why pay two people to do one job, when you could get them working on different things. However if you want to build up your team and give them loads more skills then pair programming would be great. I also think there are probably some problems that are crying out for pair programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Javascript progress</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/javascript-progress/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/javascript-progress/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got excited earlier this week as I started playing around with the javascript I have been learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I would try and create useful javascript that could be applied to an online filestore. Somewhere that you could upload, delete, edit files and folders and various options to do with your files would popup via javascript or jquery code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I have created a static HTML page which lists a few dummy files. I have added a button which adds a new row into my table and I have used jquery to highlight any selected files and also when the mouse passes over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to follow my progress I have put my files on &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/CodeSamples/tree/master/clouds-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
. It’s very basic stuff and I have already got a few lines I would like to refactor but not bad for an evenings work. I have lots of feature ideas to add to this page which should help me learn the basics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trouble with learning all this javascript is that I am starting to get all my programming languages confused. Earlier this week I started writing a for loop in javascript, only problem was I was working on an MS Access ADP (Don’t ask!) which requires the code in VBA. That is never going to work. Oh well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anyone knows good ways to stop myself getting my programming languages all confused do let me know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/hello-world-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/hello-world-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first program anyone writes in a new language is often really simple and just displays the text “Hello World!”, below are a few examples from languages I have knowledge of.&lt;/p>

My new years resolution is to do more coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over Christmas I thought I would have a go at &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.codecademy.com&lt;/a>
I completed the javascript course and I was just wondering what I should try next when I saw a tweet about &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.freecodecamp.com&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then I have been addicted to doing the exercises that they have, almost everyday I have made a bit of progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this site is not just about teaching you how to code, it has an active forum where you can ask questions and understand more about what it takes to become a developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I started these exercises I didn’t know much javascript or jquery but I am starting to learn quite a few commands that hopefully I can put into use at some point. Whatever development I end up doing I am sure I am going to need javascript at some point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the tips I have learnt is that you need to practise daily. Did you ever use flash cards to help pass exams? Well there is an electronic version of them now called Anki. Just add a question/answer pair to your deck of cards and review them each day, the ones you find difficult you review more often than the ones you have learnt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully I can keep this up and later in the year I will be well on way to writing lots of useful code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking back at 2014</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/looking-back-at-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/looking-back-at-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>As today is New Years eve I thought it would be a good chance to look back over the last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/tangle.jpg?resize=300%2C256&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the start of the year I finally got agreement for the installation of a 30MB leased line. This was an amazing achievement as I had been really struggling to keep everything working on our ADSL connections and the complexity of the connections was starting to cause problems itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However it was not a smooth process, the site survey revealed a substantial installation cost would be required, however the Council was about to launch a voucher scheme that would give us £3000 off. So most of this was just waiting around for the Council to get things going. By April we had it installed and I have been very happy with the ISP we chose, York Data Service (YDS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also during April this year was the end of support for Windows XP and Office 2003. This didn’t impact us too much, mostly due to my constant nagging of the directors to replace our oldest machines. We now only have a couple of machines still running XP and no machines running Office 2003. Most machines are now running Windows 7, I have one Director running Windows 8 for presentations and a few surveyor tablets running windows 8 as well. Like many businesses I am waiting for Windows 10 next year before doing any more substantial replacement of OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In May it was decided that I would move more into development work, so I got a new desktop PC and Visual Studio. I am very happy with my new machine (subject to dell fixing a problem later today) So far I have only dipped my toe into development work, this is largely due to needing more time to build up others to do what I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In June I made another huge achievement. I got agreement for a new server. This was our first Server 2012 server and allowed us to make huge strides towards virtualizing our services. Once we had this server up and running I was able to decommission two of our Windows Server 2003 machines well before it goes out of support next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a huge fan of this new server, I have only used a fraction of its memory. Hyper V is really great and I hope to make progress next year into HyperV replication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also during 2014 we made huge progress with our clouds software. Within the last few weeks it is running on the Azure platform which will not only make it far easier to expand and create new features it will provide us with cost savings. I am looking forward to learning more about Azure as I get deeper into development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow I achieved a lot didn’t I, on top of this I hired a new IT person and trained him up (still more to do), I have also fixed lots of printers, websites, servers (had a server motherboard die!), and made hundreds of changes to our internal databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know what is in store for 2015. I expect a lots of the same with hopefully more focus on developing in Visual Studio, training myself and my department and getting the last few tweaks into our internal servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would also like to thank everyone that I have worked with over the last 12 months (you know who you are), as you made a lot of what I have just described possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy Christmas</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/happy-christmas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/happy-christmas/</guid><description>&lt;p>I saw this tweet on twitter.&lt;/p>

Been doing some filing and found an old software developer quiz. Thought I would have a go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zogface">Keith&lt;/a> for originally writing the quiz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Questions:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a function that determines the area of a circle given the radius&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add up all the values in an array of integers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Given a table called &amp;ldquo;Nodes&amp;rdquo; with the following structure and sample data (see below after questions):
…where ID is the primary key,andParentID references ID, complete the following:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>write a stored procedure to return all nodes beneath a given node ID&lt;/li>
&lt;li>describe how you might write a query to return all nodes at any depth below a given node ID (i.e. recursively)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write a function to get the prime numbers up to 1,000,000&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ve been given the following code to review (below table)– what comments would you give back to the developer?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>ID&lt;/th>
&lt;th>ParentID&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Name&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Type&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Depth&lt;/th>

&lt;p>What’s with that? Why am I in a programming mood when I have boxes to pack and shelves to take apart?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the last few weeks I have been too busy with other things to do much programming or when I had the time I felt more like relaxing than learning anything new.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do I get into the programming zone, what was it about this particular weekend that made me want to? Was it just the fact I had no time to concentrate on it, or is there some more useful factor that controls my desire to code?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can think of a few factors that I should make note of.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Peace and quiet – Friday night I had the place to myself so I could concentrate and do whatever I wanted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideas – Before I started I had some ideas, why don’t I try doing x. Once I have a coding idea I need to investigate it and see where it goes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break from routine – Friday night was the start of a whole week away from work, this gives me more time to forget about the daily stress of the office and think about other things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals – Work annoyed me on Friday and if I want to achieve my goal of working in development more then I need to work at it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I am not sure how I can put these into practise so that I spend more time on development but we will see. One thing I want to achieve in my new home is a quiet place to concentrate and think without distractions, I have a few options which I will investigate over the next few weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway need to get back to packing boxes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If you had £5000 to spend on technology what would you get?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/if-you-had-5000-to-spend-on-technology-what-would-you-get/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/if-you-had-5000-to-spend-on-technology-what-would-you-get/</guid><description>&lt;p>I listen to the dot net rocks podcast and they ask this question every show. (If you don’t listen then you should!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know what my answer would be as there are so many gadgets and cool things that I like the sound of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I might get a surface pro 3, it’s a tablet with attachable keyboard that’s more powerful than my current laptop. But at £600 it’s expensive so maybe not. Maybe instead I would install a SSD into my existing laptop to increase disk performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d like a new car with lots of gadgets built-in. A friend gave me a ride in his new BMW and it’s nice. Bluetooth so I don’t have to have an audio cable to listen to podcasts. Parking sensors so no chance the wife will prang it. Built in satnav etc&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/google-car.png?w=599&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we are on the subject of cars eventually I’d like a google self driving car as I think Google is a better driver than me. Think about it I drive to a friends I have a drink I sleep in the back seat as my car drives me home. Once all cars are automated I believe the roads will be much safer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last thing I would spend on is an intensive training course on development, I would really like to get further in dev and more training would really help. Specifically something that would help solve my current dev problems. I am sure it is possible for me to learn dev with self-study but that requires a discipline I don’t think I have, I easily eat my time up with my current job, wife and other interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently had £6500 to spend on improving my employers IT infrastructure. That was really hard. It sounds like a lot of money, but it really isn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I started looking at the problems that I wanted to solve and what hardware I wanted I quickly used it all up and that was before I factored in license and software costs. In the end I just had to order what I wanted and hope that on a future date I could spend on other areas. I got a super powerful server that I could virtualize almost all our existing physical servers with it I needed licences, which left me just enough to get a NAS for file storage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interview questions</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/interview-questions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/interview-questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have done a few interviews from both sides of the table, I’m not very good at either but thought I would have a go at answering my favourite questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/how-not-to-ace-the-technical-interview.jpg?w=550&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Describe an IT disaster and what you did to turn it around?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question is all about the turn it around bit. I’ve had lots of answers that emphasise the problem rather than what the candidate did to turn things around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My answer would be: on a Saturday I was rearranging the server room and when I came to turn on our main file server and pdc it wouldn’t boot. My plans for the weekend went out the window it was all about getting this server back up. I tried the usual unplug everything and reconnect still nothing. I rang a friend to get a second opinion and between the two of us we formulated a plan of action. I then rang my director to tell her that I was having problems and what I was going to try. (keeping people informed is an essential skill)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the server in question was getting power but nothing was happening during boot. The motherboard had died. What I needed to do was connect the raid card to another server so I could copy the data from it to our Nas drive (luckily I had an upgrade plan and this failure had just accelerated it)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few hours later the data was copying and I could breathe again. I told my director that I had fixed things but there would be minor issues on Monday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Describe your strengths and weaknesses?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wouldn’t be an interview without a strengths and weaknesses question. As an interviewer I want at least one weakness and I want it to actually be a weakness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My strengths are my problem solving skills, I can look at a problem and investigate what is going on and find a solution. If its a technology I haven’t used before I can read up about it and find out how it works and then use it to solve the issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My weakness is my interpersonal skills, I am much better at analysing a computer issue than figuring out why one member of my staff is not performing. This is an area that is improving over the last few years I have taken on more responsibility over people and I am learning more about getting the best out of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Technical Questions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have never included technical questions in one of my interviews until recently and I think it is a good way to gauge ability. I often come out of an interview unsure how well that person would perform under the stresses of my job. If I have something down on paper it is a good start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the personality that comes through during the interview must also be considered as most knowledge can be taught.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good technical question I have used in the past is write a paragraph explaining DHCP. This question illustrates what their knowledge is like for an essential technology, but it also indicates what their writing style is like. Could the passage they have written be given to a Director or Client?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good IT people need both technical knowledge and the ability to communicate at all levels, I still struggle to know if someone is good or not and even sometimes if I am any good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To boldly go where no SQL has gone before Part 2</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s continue looking at a database schema for storing details of every Star Trek Episode. If you are new to databases, a schema is just the design of the structure of the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have three tables, Episode, EpisodeWriter and Writer. See my last post for more details of these. It has been suggested that a slight change to this structure would enable storage of more of the creative staff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets rename Writer and call it Credit, and rename EpisodeWriter and call it EpisodeCredit. Now any creative staff member involved in an episode can be stored in the Credit table. Lets alter EpisodeCredit and add an extra column called CreditType. CreditType is just a text field that stores the role that creative person had on that episode, it can be anything from Director, Writer, Actor, Science Consultant etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We now have the ability to store information relating to the episode in the episode table and any creative people in the credit table. What else can we add to the database? How about a table that can be used to record when an episode was last watched. I am probably weird but sometimes I want to watch a Star Trek episode that I like but I haven’t watched in ages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last watched table is really simple and just have a datetime field and episodeId. This can be further expanded to have a userId field if you wanted to keep track of what episodes your friends had been watching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another idea could be to tag episodes with certain themes or topics like Klingon episodes or meaning of life episodes or Kirk talks a computer to death episodes. Again this is fairly simple table containing TagName and EpisodeId.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To boldly go where no SQL has gone before</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/to-boldly-go-where-no-sql-has-gone-before/</guid><description>&lt;p>My last post proved quite popular so I am wondering if I can combine a post about IT and Star Trek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years ago I used to have lists of Star Trek episodes, which included such information like original air date, production number, episode title and brief description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that was hard to keep track of was how many episodes were written by a specific person. This is because episodes are written by multiple people. A column called writer would then need to contain multiple people, another option would be to have columns called writer1, writer2 etc. This wouldn’t help either as you wouldn’t know which column a specific writer had been saved in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/manytomany.jpg?w=559&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The relationship between writer and episode is known as a many to many relationship. An episode can have many writers and a writer can have written many episodes. To achieve this structure in a SQL database you will need three database tables as it is not possible to create a many to many join between two tables. The first table will contain all the episodes, the second table will contain all the writers, the third table known as a junction table, will contain the relationship between the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s do an example so we can see how this would work. Gene Roddenberry creator of Star Trek wrote the pilot episode ‘The Cage’. So Gene would be added to the writers table with an id of 1 and The Cage would be added to the episode table with an id of 1. In the junction table, it has two columns episode and writer, so we would enter 1 and 1 into these columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Select&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">from&lt;/span> Episode e
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Join&lt;/span> EpisodeWriter ew &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">on&lt;/span> e.id &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> ew.EpisodeId
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Join&lt;/span> Writer w &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">on&lt;/span> w.id &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> ew.WriterId
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But if Gene Coon and Gene Roddenberry had writing credits on The Cage we would need to add Gene Coon to the writing table and add an extra entry to the episodewriter table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to do more posts based on this as I expand the database structure to include other information, I may go on to create stored procedures for bringing back certain information or I may use this as an example to talk about coding a user interface.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Destination Star Trek</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/destination-star-trek/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/destination-star-trek/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a break from my usual topics I am going to talk about what I did over the weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10670061_10152884492389155_77781042960777157_n.jpg" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a huge star trek fan, so me and my wife Laura went to Destination Star Trek, a convention held in London. This is a picture of us in costume, my wife created a tribble costume (A tribble is an alien race that just consists of a ball of fur) and I am wearing an original series captains uniform. We had a great time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several things that made this trip special.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Friends&lt;/strong>: After the last convention I remember thinking how much better the convention would be with a group of friends. Shortly afterwards I started listening to the trekmate podcast, eventually this lead to me helping out with their website and making friends via twitter with many of the hosts. This weekend was the first time I met up with them and it was great to put faces to names (or twitter names)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Writers and Directors&lt;/strong>: Star Trek has a great philosophy. In the future human beings will put their differences aside and work together to explore the galaxy, this is one reason why Star Trek is so popular even after almost 50 years. This philosophy has been created by the writers and other creative staff over the years. My favourite Star Trek film is Wrath of Khan which was directed by Nicholas Meyer, this weekend I got my DVD signed by him and was able to tell him how I still enjoyed that film over 30 years after it was made. He said that he really appreciated me saying that. Listening to his talk later on, it was fascinating to hear his insights into making my favourite film. It is the writers and directors that make our favourite characters who they are, the actors themselves aren’t allowed to ad lib, all they do is flesh them out with a bit of emotion or a mannerism, it is the writer that create our favourite lines or situations that we remember.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Seven of Nine&lt;/strong>: During my teenage years I had lots of posters of Seven on my walls. Seven of Nine was the ex-borg that walked around the ship in a skin tight catsuit, but she was also highly intelligent and continued to explore what it was to be human. It was great to have my photo taken with her, even if it was rushed due to the large number of people that wanted their picture taken.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Trivia&lt;/strong>: On the Friday of the convention, Laura took part in the beginners trivia challenge, she won. On Saturday I took part in the intermediate trivia challenge, I did really badly only got 3 correct, On Sunday I took part in the captain level challenge and I won. I really wasn’t expecting that, after I did so badly the day before. Thanks Marc Stamper and Destination Star Trek for organising that it was great fun, and also fun to meet the other trekkies who I had been competing against via twitter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Party!&lt;/strong>: On Saturday night we went to a party, we had Romulan Ale to drink, we had some of the actors performing songs (James Darren was particularly good), and some of the actors mingled with fans, it was great to see the actors relaxing and if you were lucky you could chat to them, I asked Vaughn Armstrong how he was enjoying the music, he loved it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is just a taste of what I got up to, there was lots more, like seeing alien costumes, listening to talks, sitting on a mockup of the bridge. Only one way to end this post, &lt;strong>Live Long and Prosper!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows 9 or do I mean 10</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/windows-9-or-do-i-mean-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/windows-9-or-do-i-mean-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Like many systems administrators I watched as the news came out yesterday about the latest version of windows. What would it be like? What would it be called? Would it be better or worse than previous versions?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was shocked when the name of the new operating system was revealed to be Windows 10. What really!? At first I though someone had tweeted a photoshopped image of the press conference, but no it was really going to be called Windows 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Windows 10" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/windows_10_fullwidth.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows 10 is the next operating system to be released after windows 8, many had been calling it windows 9 or windows Threshold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft has never had a fixed naming convention for its OSes, so should we really be that surprised at its new name.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Windows 1.0 (1985)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 2.0 (1987)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 3.0 (1990)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 95 (1995)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 98 (1998)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows ME (2000)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows XP (2001)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows Vista (2007)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 7 (2009)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 8 (2012)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 10 (2015)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Windows 11 (2021)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One reason Microsoft may have gone with with Windows 10 is because they wanted to signify that the coming Windows release would be the last “major” Windows update. What does it mean to be the last major update?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look at the list of OSes above you will see that between XP and Vista was a huge 6 years, this gap is/has caused a huge headache for IT professionals (me included). Software was written for XP because that is all that was available, when XP moved out of support earlier this year it caused loads as problems as people tried to get this software to work on more modern OSes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If windows 10 is around for a long time we may end up with a similar situation to XP, in that loads of software will run only on it and cause problems if you try and port it to whatever comes next. I am only a trainee developer so I don’t know what is involved with building an OS, but I would imagine there must be things that are very difficult or almost impossible to fix without ripping them out and starting again which is what happens when a new version of an OS is written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only time will tell if Windows 10 really is the last version of windows and what will happen to the OS in the future. What ever the case I am downloading a preview so I can have a look (I want my start menu back!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is the difference between Development and Operations?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/what-is-the-difference-between-dev-and-ops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/what-is-the-difference-between-dev-and-ops/</guid><description>&lt;p>I want to learn Development and eventually move into a development role. But what is the difference between development and what I already do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put simply Development or programming is the creation of new programs, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IT Operations or System Administration is the administration of existing servers, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been doing System Administration since I started my job back in 2006. What you do as part of this role can be very simple like setting up new users or computers to something very complex like upgrading the version of Exchange that the company uses for its emails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of my role I have done a lot of tasks that could be described as development. I have created databases and built new database structures like tables, views and stored procedures. I have also assisted the development department with testing, setting up visual studio, building websites and databases from code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I describe myself as a developer? I would say yes, I have done plenty of work that is development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I get a job as a developer? Possibly but it would depend on the role. I have many of the skills that developers use, but I have limited knowledge in many areas. What I need to do is concentrate my efforts onto the development work I do and delegate as much administration work as I can so my knowledge can increase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Buzz word in IT at the moment is DevOps. I have lost count of the number of times .NetRocks or RunAsRadio have mentioned it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DevOps is the integration of IT Development and Operations, it emphasises the need for the two departments to work closely together to achieve common goals. In big companies the two departments can pull against each other if you are not careful, but in my case as I do both roles, it would be very difficult for the development side of myself to blame the operations side of myself for a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This I think puts me in a good position, I just need to learn more development and I will make a valuable addition to someone’s development team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I love Nagios</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/i-love-nagios/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/i-love-nagios/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nagios.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Nagios" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nagios.png?resize=212%2C50" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may not have heard of Nagios but it has saved my bacon quite a few times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is an open source server monitoring application that runs on many linux flavours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can’t remember exactly when I first installed nagios but I am guessing it was sometime in 2007/8. My boss gave me a book about it (which I never read) and told me to create a system to monitor the companies servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is not simple to set up. It relies on setting up various Hosts and services. Hosts are usually physical servers that you want to monitor and services are all the services you want to monitor. As this is a linux program all these can be configured by editing the right config file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is very flexible and can be expanded easily with the use of plugins, if you want to monitor something there is usually a plugin available. If you have a dell server running openmanage software there is even a plugin that allows the temperature of your server to be monitored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to monitor windows servers the use of nsclient++ is a real advantage. This is a simple client that runs as a service on your windows server. This allows nagios to track memory, cpu, disk space, performance and services, in fact almost everything that you would want to monitor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years I have kept a close eye on Nagios and added extra checks as new services were added or problems encountered. A few years ago I dabbled with sending alerts out via SMS message and once I got a smart phone found an app to keep track of Nagios 24/7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But recently I have started wondering if Nagios is the best way to monitor modern servers like 2012 or remote services like Azure. I want something that is easy to expand as your IT infrastructure expands. Something that relies on running on a linux OS requires your IT staff have a knowledge of linux and you keep that server maintained and updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My question is: Is Nagios still the best way to monitor my servers?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/about/</guid><description>&lt;img alt="Funky Si profile image" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1922276.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; height: 150px" />

&lt;p>For more details about Have I been pwned? check out &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com">www.troyhunt.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pwned Pass is a simple Xamarin app that allows you to type in a password and tells you if it has been used in a data breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Troy Hunt of &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?&lt;/a> recently added a new API to his website which allows you to search his extensive database of pwned passwords, over 306 million of them. I have simply created a Android frontend to this API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be noted:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong>Do not send any password you actively use to a third-party service – even mine!&lt;/strong> I don’t log anything that you type into my app and this app makes use of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/">&lt;i>k&lt;/i>-anonymity&lt;/a> feature to avoid transmitting passwords.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As well as using Troy’s new API I also take advantage of his existing API’s. You can search his extensive database of email addresses to see if you have been affected by a data breach all from my android app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pwned Pass is now available from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pwnedpasswords.pwnedpasswords">Google Play Store&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
