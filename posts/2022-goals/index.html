</span>
<br><br>
<p>Lets have a look at what my goals were for 2021. I had eight of them, lets look at them one by one.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure certification</strong>. In May of this year I sat and passed the Azure Fundamentals exam. I am calling this goal as achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mentoring</strong>. I didn&rsquo;t do anything about working with others or mentoring, so not sure I achieved this one. However I do now work in a development team and I have been reviewing others code and having my own reviewed. We have a junior developer and I am enjoying the opportunities I have to work with him and share my wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>F#</strong>. I have done zero work with F# in 2021, so this one I didn&rsquo;t achieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cosmos db/Mongo db</strong>. I have worked with both of these technologies in 2021. I used Cosmos the most with my website, and storing data for it. I used Mongo/Atlas for auditing for a project I did for my previous job. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was expert in either of these, but I am starting to get a flavour of non SQL Server databases. I should also note that I am using mysql a lot in my latest job, so another non SQL Server technology that I get to use on a daily basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give a talk</strong>. I said last year that maybe I would make baby steps towards doing this, and I have. In the interview for my new job I gave a short presentation (I thought it was bad, but others didn&rsquo;t!) I also gave a short introduction to Blazor talk which went down well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mandlebrot Generator</strong>. Did nothing on this one as well. I may have googled the code but that is as far as I got.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pwned Pass Mobile App</strong>. I got an increase in users in 2021 and hence it it still running and I still pay for the API key. I am still considering what to do with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time for me</strong>. Achieved this one, had plenty of time for myself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=not-a-bad-year-but-what-are-my-goals-for-2022>Not a bad year but what are my goals for 2022?</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Video</strong>. I have just purchased a green screen, so my first goal is to learn how to use OBS, how to light myself properly without getting horrible reflections. I have the content for my first talk, the talk I gave at work about Blazor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conference</strong>. Attend an in person conference. I am booked to attend Scottish Summit, however it has been postponed due to COVID-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blog More</strong>. I have been neglecting writing blog posts a bit recently, so I want to do more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>. I have been recording various metrics from twitter, github etc and I would like to expand this and make it a service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Profile Pic</strong>. My profile pic is getting a bit old, so it would be nice to update the images I use online and improve my personal brand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
