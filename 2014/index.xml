What would it be like? What would it be called? Would it be better or worse than previous versions?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was shocked when the name of the new operating system was revealed to be Windows 10. What really!? At first I though someone had tweeted a photoshopped image of the press conference, but no it was really going to be called Windows 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Windows 10" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/windows_10_fullwidth.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows 10 is the next operating system to be released after windows 8, many had been calling it windows 9 or windows Threshold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft has never had a fixed naming convention for its OSes, so should we really be that surprised at its new name.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Windows 1.0 (1985)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 2.0 (1987)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 3.0 (1990)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 95 (1995)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 98 (1998)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows ME (2000)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows XP (2001)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows Vista (2007)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 7 (2009)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 8 (2012)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Windows 10 (2015)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One reason Microsoft may have gone with with Windows 10 is because they wanted to signify that the coming Windows release would be the last “major” Windows update. What does it mean to be the last major update?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look at the list of OSes above you will see that between XP and Vista was a huge 6 years, this gap is/has caused a huge headache for IT professionals (me included). Software was written for XP because that is all that was available, when XP moved out of support earlier this year it caused loads as problems as people tried to get this software to work on more modern OSes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If windows 10 is around for a long time we may end up with a similar situation to XP, in that loads of software will run only on it and cause problems if you try and port it to whatever comes next. I am only a trainee developer so I don’t know what is involved with building an OS, but I would imagine there must be things that are very difficult or almost impossible to fix without ripping them out and starting again which is what happens when a new version of an OS is written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only time will tell if Windows 10 really is the last version of windows and what will happen to the OS in the future. What ever the case I am downloading a preview so I can have a look (I want my start menu back!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is the difference between Development and Operations?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/what-is-the-difference-between-dev-and-ops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/what-is-the-difference-between-dev-and-ops/</guid><description>&lt;p>I want to learn Development and eventually move into a development role. But what is the difference between development and what I already do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put simply Development or programming is the creation of new programs, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IT Operations or System Administration is the administration of existing servers, websites or databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been doing System Administration since I started my job back in 2006. What you do as part of this role can be very simple like setting up new users or computers to something very complex like upgrading the version of Exchange that the company uses for its emails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of my role I have done a lot of tasks that could be described as development. I have created databases and built new database structures like tables, views and stored procedures. I have also assisted the development department with testing, setting up visual studio, building websites and databases from code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I describe myself as a developer? I would say yes, I have done plenty of work that is development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can I get a job as a developer? Possibly but it would depend on the role. I have many of the skills that developers use, but I have limited knowledge in many areas. What I need to do is concentrate my efforts onto the development work I do and delegate as much administration work as I can so my knowledge can increase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Buzz word in IT at the moment is DevOps. I have lost count of the number of times .NetRocks or RunAsRadio have mentioned it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DevOps is the integration of IT Development and Operations, it emphasises the need for the two departments to work closely together to achieve common goals. In big companies the two departments can pull against each other if you are not careful, but in my case as I do both roles, it would be very difficult for the development side of myself to blame the operations side of myself for a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This I think puts me in a good position, I just need to learn more development and I will make a valuable addition to someone’s development team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I love Nagios</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/i-love-nagios/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2014/i-love-nagios/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nagios.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Nagios" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nagios.png?resize=212%2C50" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may not have heard of Nagios but it has saved my bacon quite a few times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is an open source server monitoring application that runs on many linux flavours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can’t remember exactly when I first installed nagios but I am guessing it was sometime in 2007/8. My boss gave me a book about it (which I never read) and told me to create a system to monitor the companies servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is not simple to set up. It relies on setting up various Hosts and services. Hosts are usually physical servers that you want to monitor and services are all the services you want to monitor. As this is a linux program all these can be configured by editing the right config file&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nagios is very flexible and can be expanded easily with the use of plugins, if you want to monitor something there is usually a plugin available. If you have a dell server running openmanage software there is even a plugin that allows the temperature of your server to be monitored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to monitor windows servers the use of nsclient++ is a real advantage. This is a simple client that runs as a service on your windows server. This allows nagios to track memory, cpu, disk space, performance and services, in fact almost everything that you would want to monitor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years I have kept a close eye on Nagios and added extra checks as new services were added or problems encountered. A few years ago I dabbled with sending alerts out via SMS message and once I got a smart phone found an app to keep track of Nagios 24/7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But recently I have started wondering if Nagios is the best way to monitor modern servers like 2012 or remote services like Azure. I want something that is easy to expand as your IT infrastructure expands. Something that relies on running on a linux OS requires your IT staff have a knowledge of linux and you keep that server maintained and updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My question is: Is Nagios still the best way to monitor my servers?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
