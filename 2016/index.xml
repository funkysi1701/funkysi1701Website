&lt;p>So lets sign up for a free trial and see what it can do. &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="Amazon Web Services" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aws-300x169.png?resize=300%2C169" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AWS free trial is available from &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/free/&lt;/a>
and lasts for 12 months. From memory I think the Azure free trial lasted only one month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start you need to login with your amazon account and create an AWS account. This requires your name and address and your payment info (you will only get billed if use services not covered by your free trial).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly AWS requires you to verify your identity via an automated phone call. (I don’t recall doing anything like this for Azure but please correct me if I am wrong.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you are logged in you get a series of links displaying all the different services that are available. First impression is this is a simpler view to Azure’s portal with a similar amount of services. At the top right is an option to select which region you want to use, in Azure I use North Europe and West Europe, AWS has Ireland and Frankfurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-web-app">Create a Web App&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#create-a-web-app">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First thing to try is setting up a website. I selected create a web app and I get a page asking me for its basic details (very similar to Azure, however AWS asked what language your code is written in, Azure handles all of these) AWS websites appear to support a host of different options similar to Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The actual creation of your website takes a few moments (like on Azure). However the default URL for websites is similar to &lt;a href="http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.vjbbimyv7w.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/&lt;/a>
which is not quite as nice as the Azure equivalent &lt;a href="http://test.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://test.azurewebsites.net&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azure has a host of command lines available via powershell. AWS has a similar command line interface called AWS CLI, including the option to deploy from git to your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is an extension that allows for the publishing of websites to AWS. (Just like you can publish to Azure)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I learn more about AWS I will continue to blog about it. &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/08/04/amazon-web-services-pt-2/">Amazon Web Services Pt 2&lt;/a>

&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="100-posts-old-L-fwCF_f" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/100-posts-old-L-fwCF_f-300x247.jpeg?resize=300%2C247" loading="lazy"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So what have I learned in the past 100 posts?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It is easier to write a blog before you become a parent. More recently I am increasingly finding it difficult to find the time to blog. It used to be that I could write on an evening, but now James is around I often prefer to play with him, or more often stop him crawling where he shouldn’t.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like my job. The inspiration for most of this site is my day job and as you can read, I do a wide variety of different things, but I have a lot more to learn as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finding your niche is hard. 100 posts in and I am still not sure what my niche is. I started out with the broad niche of IT and what I do, I then considered something about IT and fatherhood but I don’t think that topic is really me. My current thinking is maybe DevOps especially as my role these days fits squarely between Development and Operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Its time for a refresh. I have been meaning to change the theme of this site for some time and I feel after 100 posts now is as good as time as any. I want to emphasise my skills and what I am learning and increase the emphasis on DevOps, which I think will be my niche.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching visitor numbers is addictive. Every day I look at how many people have looked at my blog, but I have yet to see a pattern between what I write and how many reads I get. Is my writing getting better? I don’t know. Are more people reading? Probably not. Will I keep going? Yes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So what is next?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully a refreshed look in the next few months. Hopefully regular posts. If there is something you want to see on here drop me a message via any of the social media links or put a comment below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is my favourite post?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/05/30/user-groups-and-f/">User Groups and F#&lt;/a>
which proved very popular and got me to start going to user groups something I still enjoy today. I also like &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2016/02/25/coding-myself-into-a-corner/">Coding Myself Into A Corner&lt;/a>
which got me to start thinking more if I was giving myself future problems. But there are many others I like such as &lt;a href="https://www.funkysi1701.com/2015/09/03/baby-magic-and-becoming-a-father/">James and Becoming a father&lt;/a>
