Well since then my Raspberry Pi has been sat on a desk collecting dust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week I attended Leeds Sharp and the topic was &lt;strong>Running Windows on Raspberry Pi&lt;/strong> and this has inspired me again to do something with a Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But first what did I learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are a couple more of pics of last nights &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeedsSharp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LeedsSharp&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/QvlsYjNFvB">https://t.co/QvlsYjNFvB&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RaspberryPi?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RaspberryPi&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSIoT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MSIoT&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/60o4wiiPSv">pic.twitter.com/60o4wiiPSv&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Richard Tasker ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ (@ritasker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ritasker/status/725970415189909504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2016&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>I had heard that a cut down version of Windows 10 could be installed on the newer Raspberry Piâ€™s, but I hadnâ€™t really understood how cut down the version of windows is. Having now seen it demonstrated the OS consists of a single page with a few menu options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real power of Windows 10 IoT is when you connect remotely to it. There are a couple of ways to do this, PowerShell (check out &lt;a href="https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm&lt;/a>
for a few commands), and of course connecting Visual Studio to your Pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I had previously played with a Pi, it had been with bash scripts and linux commands. The beauty of installing Windows IoT is that you can write c# code, something I do in my day job so theoretically I should find it easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The demonstration at Leeds Sharp was pretty impressive. If you are a fan of the Big Bang Theory you may recall Sheldon playing a Theremin. Well it is actually possible to construct a Theremin from a couple of sensors and a Raspberry Pi. The code for which is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritasker/IoTDemos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I have been inspired what shall I do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Raspberry Pi wonâ€™t support Windows 10 IoT, so I need to buy the latest version. I am thinking of buying a kit so I can play about with a breadboard, LEDs and resistors. Maybe not build a robot straight away but certainly try doing something that connects to the GPIO pins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any suggestions leave a comment below.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
