I work for a company that provides a cloud computing website, but what is Cloud Computing?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) defines it as “Cloud computing involves deploying groups of remote servers and software networks that allow centralized data storage and online access to computer services or resources.”

Erm. What does that mean? Well in simple terms it means storing you data on a remote server. Any time you submit information onto a website, you are submitting your information to the “Cloud”

But there is more that the Cloud can do for you. The search giant Google, which also develops the android mobile phone operating system, have developed a range of cloud computing products. The Google Drive product allows you to upload and even create files, these files are saved into the Cloud, once in the cloud they can be accessed from any device that has an internet connection. No longer do you run the risk of your favourite file being on a computer that won’t turn on or being on a dead hard drive, save it to the cloud and you will always have access to it.

Google isn’t the only one that does this, Microsoft have OneDrive which they are incorporating into the heart of their operating system, Apple and many other companies have released similar products.

This age of cloud computing allows a clearer separation between your data and your device. It won’t be long before whatever device you are using your files will be there to be worked on. You are in the office working on a spreadsheet, you save it to the Cloud, you can then continue working on it with your tablet while on the road. Just before bed you want to check if you added something to that doc, so you quickly check your phone. How cool is this!

But if I put my system administer hat on, Cloud computing goes far further than that. Microsoft Azure allows many of the services you would typically have running on your server, saved into the cloud. This has many advantages and allows you to concentrate on other problems while leaving the cloud to look after these services.
