WOW! I have reached the milestone of 50 blog posts.

![](https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/top-50-2012.jpg)

I have tried to blog at least every week and I have learnt a lot. I have talked about my work, technology, things I have learnt, things I want to do and many more things.
