I saw this tweet on twitter.

```
He’s making a database,
He’s filtering twice
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE behaviour = Nice
Santa Clause is Coming to town.
```

This started me thinking surely in a normalized database structure behaviour wouldn’t be stored in the customer table, so I propose the following change.

```
He’s making a database,
He’s filtering twice
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE EXISTS (select * from behaviour where behaviour.CustomerId = customers.Id and behaviour.Type = Nice)
Santa Clause is Coming to town.
```

Happy Christmas everyone, hope you all have restful holidays.
