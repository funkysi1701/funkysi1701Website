Lets have a look at what my goals were for 2021. I had eight of them, lets look at them one by one.

1. **Azure certification**. In May of this year I sat and passed the Azure Fundamentals exam. I am calling this goal as achieved. 

2. **Mentoring**. I didn't do anything about working with others or mentoring, so not sure I achieved this one. However I do now work in a development team and I have been reviewing others code and having my own reviewed. We have a junior developer and I am enjoying the opportunities I have to work with him and share my wisdom.

3. **F#**. I have done zero work with F# in 2021, so this one I didn't achieve.

4. **Cosmos db/Mongo db**. I have worked with both of these technologies in 2021. I used Cosmos the most with my website, and storing data for it. I used Mongo/Atlas for auditing for a project I did for my previous job. I wouldn't say I was expert in either of these, but I am starting to get a flavour of non SQL Server databases. I should also note that I am using mysql a lot in my latest job, so another non SQL Server technology that I get to use on a daily basis.

5. **Give a talk**. I said last year that maybe I would make baby steps towards doing this, and I have. In the interview for my new job I gave a short presentation (I thought it was bad, but others didn't!) I also gave a short introduction to Blazor talk which went down well.

6. **Mandlebrot Generator**. Did nothing on this one as well. I may have googled the code but that is as far as I got.

7. **Pwned Pass Mobile App**. I got an increase in users in 2021 and hence it it still running and I still pay for the API key. I am still considering what to do with it.

8. **Time for me**. Achieved this one, had plenty of time for myself.
 
### Not a bad year but what are my goals for 2022?

1. **Video**. I have just purchased a green screen, so my first goal is to learn how to use OBS, how to light myself properly without getting horrible reflections. I have the content for my first talk, the talk I gave at work about Blazor.

2. **Conference**. Attend an in person conference. I am booked to attend Scottish Summit, however it has been postponed due to COVID-19.

3. **Blog More**. I have been neglecting writing blog posts a bit recently, so I want to do more. 

4. **Metrics**. I have been recording various metrics from twitter, github etc and I would like to expand this and make it a service. 

5. **Profile Pic**. My profile pic is getting a bit old, so it would be nice to update the images I use online and improve my personal brand.
