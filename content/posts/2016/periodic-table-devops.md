The periodic table lists all the chemical elements and groups them together based on some key properties. Today I found an article about the [periodic table of DevOps](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/).

I am not going to discuss every element but I thought I might go through some that I have heard of or used.

- Github – The repository of lots of open source software. My Github can be found at https://github.com/funkysi1701
- Amazon Web Services – The second most popular cloud computing provider (not sure why this isn’t number 3?)
- Git – The distributed source control system that everyone uses these days.
- Azure – The number one cloud provider, I have used this a lot, mostly with websites but also with some of their other features like Traffic Manager.
- Bitbucket – like Github but allows private repositories. I have used this extensively for work based projects that I don’t want to be public.
- Google Cloud Platform – don’t know much about this one, but no surprise that google wants a piece of the cloud computing pie.
- Selenium – This is a product I want to play about with as allows front end testing with a browser.
- Rackspace – Before we made the jump to Azure we made use of some Rackspace servers.
- Subversion – The first source control system that I used, but been using git so long now not sure I can remember how it worked.
- Visual Studio – The IDE from Microsoft that I use to write code. I am a big fan as it does everything I could want.
- TeamCity – The continuous integration software that I have been using to automate my deployments.
- MSBuild – This is used by Visual Studio to build your software and can also be used by your deployment scripts.
- Trello – A website that allows you to create a board of ideas or things to do.
- Slack – Brings all your communication together in one place. It’s real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams.
- New Relic – A software analytics tool suite used by developers, ops, and software companies to understand how your applications are performing. Useful but find myself favouring Application Insights (part of Azure) more now.
- Nagios – Yay nagios is on the list! My favourite server monitoring system.
- Splunk – This application can be used to search, monitor and analyse all your log files to find out what is happening. Don’t currently use it but I have tried it out in the past.
