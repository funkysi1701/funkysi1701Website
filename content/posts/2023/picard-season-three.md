Last night I had a bit of a chat about season 3 of Star Trek Picard.

Here is the episode I recorded: [TTNN Ep 36 - PIC S3ep1 Reaction Chat](https://anchor.fm/daniel-peter-hitch/episodes/TTNN-Ep-36---PIC-S3ep1-Reaction-Chat-e1vdglo)

Dan and Dan are joined by previous Temporal Trek guest Si Foster for a little chinwag over the return of PICARD for the final season.

Badass Bev, Starships of Thesseus, love to loathe Captain Shaw, Predictions and More.

It was great fun to record and I hope you enjoy giving it a listen., Hopefully I will be back at the end of the season to discuss the conclusion.
