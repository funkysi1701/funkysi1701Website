As I write this I have less than 2 days until the due date for the birth of my first child.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its a very exciting time, but it is also infuriating waiting for it to arrive. Even in the 21st century science can not predict with any accuracy when a baby is going to arrive and we just have to wait for mother nature to do its thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like I am stuck in limbo at the moment I have lots of work to do, lots of development changes to do on the databases, but I also know that at a moments notice I need to drop what I am doing and try and be a father.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due dates for babies is based on average pregnancies lasting 40 weeks, but there is no such thing as an average pregnancy. But to keep this blog post on topic I somehow need to compare due dates for pregnancy with software development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In software development we often get asked for estimates on when a particular development task will be finished. Estimates in software development are very difficult to make accurate as there are so many variables that you do not know the answer to until you start getting stuck into doing the work. One technique is to try and split the work down into small steps and estimate how long each small step will take and then add them all together. But even this technique still has a large margin of error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What would it be like if when management asked we gave an estimate similar to what pregnant women receive? Instead of a deadline when all work has to be finished by, you have a date when there is a 50% chance of the work being finished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think management would have a difficult time dealing with this amount of uncertainty, I certainly am waiting for this baby to arrive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How complex are my stored procedures?</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/how-complex-are-my-stored-procedures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2015 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2015/how-complex-are-my-stored-procedures/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently me and my development team have been looking at performance and how to improve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One area of improvement we have identified is with our stored procedures, which we plan to rewrite. But how do we identify which are the easiest to rewrite and which are the hardest?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first thought was maybe to count the number of times each keyword is used and rank them somehow. eg each JOIN gets 5, OUTER APPLY gets 20, each term in WHERE gets 1, and then combine that with the length of the query and how many parameters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However doing a bit of googling I came across the following &lt;a href="https://aalamrangi.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/calculate-tsql-stored-procedure-complexity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Calculate-TSQL-Stored-831b683a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sql script&lt;/a>
. This script analyses the stored procedures in terms of number of lines of code, number of parameters and number of dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The complexity is divided into SIMPLE, MEDIUM and COMPLEX.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>WHEN NumberOfLines * NumberOfDependencies * NumberOfParameters &amp;lt; 5000 THEN ‘Simple’
WHEN NumberOfLines * NumberOfDependencies * NumberOfParameters &amp;lt; 10000 THEN ‘Medium’
ELSE ‘Complex’
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://storageaccountblog9f5d.blob.core.windows.net/blazor/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reportscreenshot1.png?w=674&amp;amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gives a fairly good estimate of which stored procedures are the most complex and which would probably take the longest time to rewrite.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
