&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mermaid&lt;/a>
is a tool that lets you create diagrams from code and text. I first came across this tool about a year ago for use in a project. I had forgotten about this tool until the other day, when I was thinking about this problem again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is it possible to embed a mermaid diagram in the markdown used in a github repo? Well the answer is yes, so lets look at how that works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple mermaid diagram looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>graph TD;
A[fff]---&amp;gt;B;
A---&amp;gt;C;
B---&amp;gt;D;
C---&amp;gt;D;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>which renders like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/mermaid.png" loading="lazy"
width="630" height="912"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at what it is doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TD means the chart is top down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A is the name of a node in the chart, [fff] is a label being applied to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we just define the relationships between the different nodes, you can have &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;, &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; or &amp;mdash;, or even&lt;br/> &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at my architecture. I have a database (cosmosDB), I have a website running on Azure Static Web Apps, I have some Azure functions for getting data into and out of my database. I also have Application Insights monitoring the whole thing. I also have a console app for doing some data import stuff. This produces a diagram like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/mermaid2.png" loading="lazy"
width="409" height="445"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code to produce this and display it on my &lt;a href="https://github.com/funkysi1701/Blogv2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github repo&lt;/a>
is simply&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>```mermaid
graph TD
A[Azure Static Web App]---B[Http Fn]
B---D[Database]
C[Timer Fn]---D
D---E[Import Console App]
F[App Insights]---A
F---B
F---C
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Pretty nice for a few lines of code to show what system talks with what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are improvements that can be made to the diagram, for example changing the shapes of the different services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eg &lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/mermaid3.png" loading="lazy"
width="1034" height="253"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What diagrams are you going to build?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scottish Summit 2022</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/scottishsummit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 18:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/scottishsummit/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 10th and 11th June 2022 &lt;a href="https://scottishsummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottish Summit 2022&lt;/a>
happened and I was there. It was an awesome event and I will attempt to summarise what happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thursday-9th">Thursday 9th&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#thursday-9th">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Thursday 9th I travelled down on the train full of excitement about the event. Once I got to the hotel, I was immediately greeted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialCookJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Cook&lt;/a>
, I was obviously in the right place, this weekend is going to be good.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="friday-10th">Friday 10th&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#friday-10th">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The hotel was less then 5 mins walk to the conference, which was being held at the Technology and Innovation Centre, University of Strathclyde. Registration was simple wave your tickets (which were free, apart from a contribution to charity), and you get your badge and a wrist band. (Pink for people contact, blue for hold back) I then got chatting to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrKeithAtherton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith Atherton&lt;/a>
, who amazingly lived in part of the world where I grew up. (Amazing what you learn at conferences!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/scottishsummit.jpg" align="left" >Time for the Keynote talk. Which of course because we are in scotland was introduced by bagpipes marching through the room! The talk was given by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmcginley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connell McGinley&lt;/a>
and was titled Disability Awareness &amp;amp; Inclusivity. This talk was amazing. Connell is deaf and gave the entire talk with sign language and this was translated for the rest of us to hear. Connell talked about his career and the barriers he faced. Microsoft Teams was an amazing improvement to his work life, as the captioning allowed him to talk with customers for the first time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purple pound is the amount of spending power people with some kind of disability (15% of the worlds population) have and it is approx $13 trillion. If businesses can open their products up to more people it is a win for everyone. This was a really powerful way to open up the conference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davesmall28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Small&lt;/a>
talking about Azure DevOps pipelines and Power Platform. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Power Platform however all the DevOps stuff was great, some of it reinforced stuff I already knew, some was new.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samcogan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Cogan&lt;/a>
was next talking about Infrastructure as Code. Resources for this talk are on his &lt;a href="https://github.com/sam-cogan/events/tree/main/Scottish%20Summit%202022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github&lt;/a>
This was a great comparison of different tools for doing Infrastructure as Code. Terraform, Pulumi, Bicep, ARM templates where all covered. The difference between stateless and stateful tools. If you have a state file you need to look after it, so if you don&amp;rsquo;t need this think about using a stateless tool. If you are only using Azure consider Azure. If you are a C# (other languages are available) think about using Pulumi (which I have used and quite like)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting Started with Static Web Apps was next with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PoornimaNayar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poornima Nayar&lt;/a>
this was a great overview of Static Web Apps but as I already use Static Web Apps this was mainly reinforcing what I already knew. However the Static Web App CLI was mentioned which I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about so I am going to spend some time looking at that! Another thing that was mentioned was GraphQL which is a language agnostic way of building APIs which I also want to learn more about. Resources for this talk can be found &lt;a href="https://poornimanayar.co.uk/community/resources-for-my-talk-at-azure-thursdays-july-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next was Naming stuff in Azure with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ba4bes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbara Forbes&lt;/a>
, she went through the challenges of getting naming right, especially with all the exceptions Azure throws into the mix. Tagging your resources can really help. Also Azure Policy can help report on what you have (and even enforce it, if you are careful). Lots of interesting stuff, as my naming strategy is non existent at the moment!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Defender for Cloud Apps with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getofmeland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Gough&lt;/a>
. This was his first talk and he did really well despite technical problems. This was a security talk, I thought it was going to be about securing the apps you have built, but it was more about securing the apps that the users in your company are using. Still useful to know about, but not really my thing. Sorry Charlie!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last talk of the day was &amp;lsquo;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about Office 365&amp;rsquo; with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sharoneweaver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharon Weaver&lt;/a>
Sharon went through Shifts, Planner and Forms all included in your Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="saturday-11th">Saturday 11th&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#saturday-11th">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To start the second day I had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/webmaxru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxim Salnikov&lt;/a>
talk about Static Web apps, if I had know it was about Static Web Apps again I may have chosen a different talk but this was still a great talk. Again the CLI was mentioned which I really need to investigate further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up was James Cook&amp;rsquo;s talk Monitor Azure DevOps and GitHub with Sentinel. This was all about securing your code repositories with Sentinel and looking through the logs at what is happening. To use this tech you need either a GitHub Enterprise subscription or Azure DevOps using Azure AD Logins as it is designed more for the Enterprise than a one man band kind like me, however I will see if I can have a play around with it and see what I can learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TechieLass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Lean&lt;/a>
gave a talk about the state of IT Ops tools in the hybrid age. I enjoyed this talk, Sarah added extra fun elements like talking about the Scottish language and the highland cow. The first tool mentioned was Windows Admin Centre. I have heard about this but never used it, must have come out after I switched from Ops to Dev. Looks very Azure like. Azure Update Management was mentioned next, which I have used and works really well. This is the next generation of Update Management, a bit like WSUS from my server days. Azure Policy was mentioned again, a great tool for reporting and/or enforcing things. Azure Arc was mentioned, a way to bring Azure to you. With all these tools consider why you want to use them, what benefits do they bring, not just because it it shiny!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mental Health with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AzureRory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rory Neary&lt;/a>
. This was one of my favourite talks. Rory talked about his mental health problems, his challenges, some of his coping mechanisms some of which involved the power platform. He encouraged us all to be more open about talking about Mental Health. Lots of talks have a solution to a problem, this one didn&amp;rsquo;t, but that Ok. We are all on a journey complete with its ups and downs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Accessibility for Blazor with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DennieDeclercq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dennie Declercq&lt;/a>
. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as keen on this talk as some of the others, while I agree Accessibility is very important the solutions presented felt very generic and not really specific to Blazor. However I do have some ideas to try now and the accessibility browser extension sounds like a great idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="after-hours">After Hours&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#after-hours">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the best things about the conference was talking to people between sessions and afterwards. I am an introvert and tend to keep quiet but even I managed to talk to (for me) loads of people. Some of these I had previously connected to on twitter, and some were brand new on the day. I would encourage anyone reading this to reach out to the community, go to an event like this, you will be surprised how friendly and helpful people can be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scratch</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/scratch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 18:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/scratch/</guid><description>&lt;p>My 6 year old boy has been playing with Scratch, so here is a quick introduction to what we have learnt about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scratch is a website that allows you to &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; by combining blocks together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how the scratch website describes its self&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Scratch is the world’s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.
Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.
Scratch is always free and is available in more than 70 languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Scratch can be found by going to &lt;a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of the blocks affect your character or &amp;ldquo;sprite&amp;rdquo;, the default is a cute looking cat which may also be the scratch logo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/scratch.png" loading="lazy"
width="905" height="835"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The left hand side of the screen consists of a list of the blocks of code you can use and your coding area where you can arrange them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The right hand side shows the results of your code, where you can run and test what your code does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It didn&amp;rsquo;t take my boy long to code something like this tonight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="" src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/scratch2.png" loading="lazy"
width="712" height="725"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This game moves the &amp;ldquo;sprite&amp;rdquo; towards the mouse pointer and a message &amp;ldquo;got you&amp;rdquo; appears on screen when it reaches your mouse pointer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go through all the different blocks you can choose from, but I will highlight some of the programming concepts being learnt here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>inputs&lt;/strong> every computer program needs inputs and there are lots to choose from, things like moving the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>outputs&lt;/strong> your code needs to do something, this code moves a sprite about the screen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>variables&lt;/strong> my boy hasn&amp;rsquo;t heard of algebra yet, but he is already grasping concepts like variables, where a value can be assigned and maths can be applied to. In this example the score increases&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>loops&lt;/strong> this program keeps looping until it reaches the mouse pointer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>logic&lt;/strong> other logic commands are also available, like if / else statements, also &amp;lt;, &amp;gt; and = statements can be used&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of help and tutorials on the site to help you along, and you can customise the look and even record short sound clips to play in your code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Temporal Trek Podcast</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/temporal-trek-podcast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 18:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/temporal-trek-podcast/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this year I was a guest on the Temporal Trek Podcast.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We discuss whether this is&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A part two of a two-parter, last of a four parter or a previosuly unseen part 5 to the Tessek Prime Quintology?&lt;/li>

This is my second certification exam I have sat after the Azure Fundamentals one I sat last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/3aab54c8-a109-4018-bcad-dbe0d6a1fc0c/public_url">&lt;img src="https://www.funkysi1701.com/images/awscp.png" alt="AWS Cloud Practitioner" width="150" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time was different than the Azure one. Colleagues at work encouraged me to look into doing this particular exam and my employer is going to cover the cost of the exam itself. Last time I did the exam in my own time and didn&amp;rsquo;t really discuss it with anyone from work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other difference was this time I went to a testing centre. The centre was a 5 minute walk from the office. So I decided to work from the office today and 20 minutes before the exam started I walked to the centre. I signed a couple of bits of paper, had my photo taken, had my passport and driving license laughed at, put my belongings in a locker and I was free to start the exam. No worrying about internet connectivity or kids making noise outside my room, or the endless photos at the prep stage of an exam from home. I think I prefer the exam centre experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other difference was the first exam was Azure, this one was AWS. Both exams cover similar concepts, they are both introductions to Cloud Computing. It&amp;rsquo;s ten months since I did the Azure one, however they both had multiple choice questions and gave you the results at the end. I feel overly familir with Azure, while I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that was with AWS yet. A lot of questions relied on you knowing what AWS services are called. eg AWS Pipeline, AWS CodeStar, AWS CodeBuild, Amazon CodeGuru are all AWS services and are easily mixed up, especially as I have only used a few AWS services, while I have used a lot more of the Azure ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My memory is the Azure gave you a breakdown of your score at the end, while I am still waiting for that from todays exam. This difference may of course be due to it being in a testing centre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still prefer Azure to AWS, however today has proven that I can learn AWS stuff as well. For my next exam I want to get more hands on with my learning, as most of the services I have learnt about so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in action.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Updating SQL Server with Docker</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/updating-sqlserver-with-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/updating-sqlserver-with-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p>This morning I was listening to a podcast where the new features coming out for SQL Server 2022 were being discussed. This starting me thinking about what would be involved in upgrading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upgrading production environments is complex and there are licensing considerations to take into account. However for non production workloads like development this isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem so lets look at that first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past I have installed SQL Server Devloper Edition onto my laptop, this is fine but I have found that unless you are very careful you may end up with multiple different versions of SQL Server sitting around, and it is difficult to cleanly remove them without a fresh install of the OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However in this day and age, Docker and Containers are king. My current development environment makes use of Docker and has a docker compose file which sets up SQL Server for this particular application, lets take a look.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">sqlserver&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">image&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">container_name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">Sql&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">ports&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;5432:1433&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">networks&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">my-network&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">volumes&lt;/span>:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> - &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This defines which docker image to use, in this case 2019-latest, sets up ports and the name and saves the data on a docker volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we then run SELECT @@VERSION on this instance of SQL Server we get told:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM-CU13) (KB5005679) - 15.0.4178.1 (X64) Sep 23 2021 16:47:49 Copyright (C) 2019 Microsoft Corporation Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS) &amp;lt;X64&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>What if we change the docker-compose file to use 2022-latest?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>manifest for mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest tagged by &amp;#34;2022-latest&amp;#34; is not found
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>SQL Server 2022 hasn&amp;rsquo;t been released yet so there is no docker image for it yet. Try this command again in a few months when it is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK so what else can we try? What about a downgrade to 2017-latest? Will that work?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Server 2017 starts but the following error gets logged.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>2022-02-23 21:41:15.30 Server Software Usage Metrics is disabled.

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Doh we can&amp;rsquo;t downgrade the existing database we have. Probably a good thing really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft release regular updates for SQL Server called CU&amp;rsquo;s (Cumulative Updates), you can see above we are on CU13. Is there a CU14 or CU15 we could try?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update the docker compose to: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-CU14-ubuntu-20.04&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point I actually got an error&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>2022-02-23 21:50:20.71 Server Error: 17058, Severity: 16, State: 1.
2022-02-23 21:50:20.71 Server initerrlog: Could not open error log file &amp;#39;/var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog&amp;#39;. Operating system error = 5(Access is denied.).
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This is caused by trying to use SQL Server 2017 but it is easy to fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In docker desktop there is a volumes section, find the volume you are using with SQL Server and delete the errorlog mentioned above.&lt;/p>

/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if you retry SQL will start OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Repeating the SELECT @@VERSION gives us a new CU&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A lot has happened in the 20 years of dotnet (or .Net). It is my understanding that .Net was created to rival Java. When the .Net Framework was first created it was a windows only thing, but today modern .Net is a modern run anywhere platform, with .net applications running everywhere from PCs and Laptops, Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s, Mobile phones and tablets (via Xamarin Forms), to Websites and Microservice APIs running on every Cloud platform out there.&lt;/p>

Is it to learn new technologies and techniques? Is it to create a following? Is it to educate others? Is it to build some kind of service? Is it some combination of all of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history">History&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#history">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back when the web was young and I was first learning HTML. I hand crafted web pages, adding photos I had taken with captions. If I needed a new page I just added a new html page and linked to it from another page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As time went on I started to learn mysql and php and my website became a hand crafted php nightmare. I also applied what I learned to help my father run the website for his camera club.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point I started playing with WordPress. I have had various WordPress websites or blogs over the years. WordPress is very powerful you can do so many things, install so many plugins. WordPress runs on php and mysql and as my career started to centre around the .net space, I started to want something that was similar, so I could apply things I had learnt to my own website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has led me to the current state of my website. I have a WordPress blog, with most of my oldest content, my newer content lives on dev.to and I have a Blazor webassembly site that uses the dev.to api to run my new website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Blazor webassembly is great, however it has some limitations which I am starting to push against. To host this as cheaply as possible I am using Azure static web apps, so no .net backend all the website is front end. I have some Azure Functions that does the backend bits that I need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google and other bots are not able to find any of my pages except index, due to the way Blazor works. I have got round this by pre rendering the content using &lt;a href="https://prerender.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://prerender.io/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My next difficulty is how to generate a sitemap.xml or a rss feed for my blog. This has started to make me question my architecture decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could use a hosted solution like &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ghost&lt;/a>
which is popular with a some of my peers. This would solve many of the problems I am currently facing but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to play with everything as it is hosted and therefore someone else&amp;rsquo;s problem. How important that is I will look at later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another option would be to use github pages, there are quite a few ways to publish a github page, &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo&lt;/a>
appear to be the most popular. Both produce static content and both are a new for me to learn. Interestingly I could also publish either to Azure Static Web apps if github pages ends up not being suitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="split-in-two">Split in two&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#split-in-two">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think my website needs to be split in two. I need a stable blog platform probably using Hugo and github pages. This is what I want to get indexed by the search engines and be the primary way people find out about what I am doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then have additional sites, that I use as my playground for learning new tech. I can easily link between them and I can tweak the style so they &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; nicely together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still considering what to do with dev.to. I like that I am using it as the backend for my blog posts, and its API gives me that flexibility to display that content where I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using GitHub Actions</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/using-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/using-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running my website on Azure Static Web Apps for a while and it is pretty cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you create a Static Web App on Azure you get asked for the github repo of your source code and even the branch to use.
&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Repo for my Static Web App" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/off7ur2tgsla4smkrhhi.png" loading="lazy"
/>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have selected this, you get asked for the type of code to deploy, mine is Blazor Web Assembly but you can use Angular, React or Vue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Actions workflow creation" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ruhzjeujgl1yjxx5lng8.png" loading="lazy"
/>
You now have three variables to fill in the location in your code of the Website, the location of your Azure Functions and the output location usually wwwroot. Once you have set these three you can preview the GitHub Actions file that will be created and added to your repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get something like this&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with github actions, however I have used Azure DevOps quite a bit. Over on the Azure DevOps side I have created a pipeline that deploys to a Dev environment, then a Test environment and finally a production environment.&lt;/p>

###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The first thing I did was create three Azure Static Web Apps, I am using the free tier so while this is trippling my costs it is all still free! Doing this created three github action workflow files, I deleted two and edited the third, but before I deleted them I made a note of the AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN. If you look in your settings -&amp;gt; secrets for your repo you will see secrets have been created, this is the secure token that github uses to update your static web app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we are in settings we might as well look at environments. I created a Prod, Test and Dev environment that I was going to use in my github actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Environments can have various rules setup on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Required reviewers - this is like an approver, a user specified here must aprove for the workflow to be deployed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait time - I didn&amp;rsquo;t use this, but it looks like a certain amount of time can be set to pause the deployment. (I assume to do some kind of manual check)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployment Branch - specify what branch are allowed to be deployed to what environments. I specified develop, main and feature branches could be deployed to the Dev environment, develop and main could go on Test and main could go on Prod&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Environment secrets - I didn&amp;rsquo;t use this as my secrets were already created, however it looks like your secrets can be associated with a specific environment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now that we have the static web apps setup and the environments lets look at the github action file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all I removed the PR stuff and just concentrated on pushes. I wanted my workflow to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Push to feature branch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Dev env&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PR feature branch to develop&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once merged code gets pushed into develop&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Test env&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PR develop to main&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once merged code gets pushed into main&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deploys to Prod env (after approval)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The approval on deploying to production I think is probably overkill, but I still have it setup like that for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My gh action has three jobs defined as dev: test: and prod: they are all the same except they have the azure_static_web_apps_api_token that is correct for their environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also each have a environment defined eg&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>environment:
name: Prod
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Lastly Test and Prod have an if test setup, if the test is false the job won&amp;rsquo;t run. Importantly it won&amp;rsquo;t fail it just won&amp;rsquo;t run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Prod this needs to only run on main branch so we have&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if: github.ref == &amp;lsquo;refs/heads/main&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Test this needs to only run on develop so&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if: github.ref == &amp;lsquo;refs/heads/develop&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could have a test for develop to only run on feature/* but I have allowed it to run everytime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is loads more you can do with github actions, but hopefully this gives you a taste of some of the things you can do. I currently have a mix of Azure DevOps and github actions so I will be working on getting github actions to do more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2022 Goals</title><link>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/2022-goals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/2022/2022-goals/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lets have a look at what my goals were for 2021. I had eight of them, lets look at them one by one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Azure certification&lt;/strong>. In May of this year I sat and passed the Azure Fundamentals exam. I am calling this goal as achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mentoring&lt;/strong>. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything about working with others or mentoring, so not sure I achieved this one. However I do now work in a development team and I have been reviewing others code and having my own reviewed. We have a junior developer and I am enjoying the opportunities I have to work with him and share my wisdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>F#&lt;/strong>. I have done zero work with F# in 2021, so this one I didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cosmos db/Mongo db&lt;/strong>. I have worked with both of these technologies in 2021. I used Cosmos the most with my website, and storing data for it. I used Mongo/Atlas for auditing for a project I did for my previous job. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I was expert in either of these, but I am starting to get a flavour of non SQL Server databases. I should also note that I am using mysql a lot in my latest job, so another non SQL Server technology that I get to use on a daily basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Give a talk&lt;/strong>. I said last year that maybe I would make baby steps towards doing this, and I have. In the interview for my new job I gave a short presentation (I thought it was bad, but others didn&amp;rsquo;t!) I also gave a short introduction to Blazor talk which went down well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mandlebrot Generator&lt;/strong>. Did nothing on this one as well. I may have googled the code but that is as far as I got.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pwned Pass Mobile App&lt;/strong>. I got an increase in users in 2021 and hence it it still running and I still pay for the API key. I am still considering what to do with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time for me&lt;/strong>. Achieved this one, had plenty of time for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="not-a-bad-year-but-what-are-my-goals-for-2022">Not a bad year but what are my goals for 2022?&lt;a class="anchor ms-1" href="#not-a-bad-year-but-what-are-my-goals-for-2022">&lt;i class="fas fa-link">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video&lt;/strong>. I have just purchased a green screen, so my first goal is to learn how to use OBS, how to light myself properly without getting horrible reflections. I have the content for my first talk, the talk I gave at work about Blazor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conference&lt;/strong>. Attend an in person conference. I am booked to attend Scottish Summit, however it has been postponed due to COVID-19.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Blog More&lt;/strong>. I have been neglecting writing blog posts a bit recently, so I want to do more.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Metrics&lt;/strong>. I have been recording various metrics from twitter, github etc and I would like to expand this and make it a service.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Profile Pic&lt;/strong>. My profile pic is getting a bit old, so it would be nice to update the images I use online and improve my personal brand.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item></channel></rss>
